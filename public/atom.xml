    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I bought the 40L bag I’d been eyeing off last week. After doing a few trial packs with it, I’ve decided that I cant fit everything I want in it well enough, so tomorrow I’m taking it back to see what my other options are.</p>

<p>I can just about fit everything in the 40L bag, but it’s stuffed so tight that I have concerns about my laptop getting cracked if the bag were dropped, or something was dropped on it; and it doesnt give me any excess room whatsoever.</p>

<p>If I pull out my laptop &amp; camera bag, it feels like a better fit (still without a lot of room to spare, but I’m not scared stuff is going to get broken) so I think I’m giving up on keeping the possibility of doing carry-on only flights and resigning myself to having a separate daypack. With the laptop no longer in the 40L bag, it seems like a waste of space to have the separate front pocket &amp; laptop pocket, hence why I’m looking at swapping the 40L bag too instead of just supplementing it with a proper day pack.</p>

<p>Options I’m considering now (looking mostly within the same brand) are:</p>

<h1>Osprey Porter 46 + Some decent day pack</h1>

<p>15% larger, all in a single compartment rather than spit in two. This one still claims to be within maximum carry-on size allowed on most airlines. Not sure about which day pack to pair this with.</p>

<h1>Osprey Farpoint 55</h1>

<p>I’ve read this is basically the bag I’ve got, except with a 15L daypack that attaches on the back making up the extra 15L. I’d want to have a look and see that it’s not wasting space with another laptop pocket in the main bag, since that’ll be in the day pack.</p>

<h1>Osprey Waypoint 65</h1>

<p>50L Pack + 15L daypack. I wonder if as long as I’m resigning myself to always having checked luggage, maybe I should just make the jump to a pack where I’ll have quite a bit of space. Not so much so I can fill it up from the get go, but so I can maybe carry some useless stuff until I admit it’s useless, and so I have some extra room to pick up junk along the way?</p>

<p>I dont really know what path I want to go down at the moment; I’ve been reading so many people who say “Take less clothes, you’ll never regret it” but clothing wise it already feels like I’m going pretty light, and it’s all the other stuff that’s taking up lots of space. I’m definitely not willing to consider leaving the 11” Macbook Air or the camera stuff. The kindle seems pretty necessary. The spiky massage ball for my hip is not negotiable. I’m already down to a single set of poi and 4 juggling balls, so short of giving up one of those hobbies that are quite likely also good conversation starters there’s nothing there to leave.</p>

<p>I guess I have to admit that I’m not willing to make the sacrifices needed to travel with only one compact bag. Maybe this is one of those mistakes you have to make for yourself, or maybe that level of minimilist travel just isn’t for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So when I was last in the adventure district looking at travel gadgets and
clothing, I was talking to one of the staff in the store and he put the idea in
my head that travelling with just a small backpack would make a lot of things
easier.</p>

<p>It means you can keep your bag with you in a lot of situations where you’d
otherwise have to leave it in the luggage section and hope it doesn’t get
searched through too much by dodgy characters, and it allows you to use crowded
public transport much easier, or even just walk distances that you wouldnt want
to get stuck lugging a heavy pack.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking at this bag in particular, the Osprey Farpoint 40:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/backpacking/farpoint_40?tab=description"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/osprey-farpoint.jpg" title="Osprey Farpoint 40" alt="Osprey Farpoint 40" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a 40L backpack small enough to be allowed on airplanes as cabin luggage.
It seems pretty sturdy and from my searching, reviews seem to be generally
positive. It’s good a nice section in the front that holds a laptop &amp; ereader.
It’s got a lifetime warranty, and the guy at the store was telling me they’d
send you out a replacement bag to wherever you are at that time, if it broke
for any reason.</p>

<p>If I do get this bag, I’m planning on getting one of these neato dry daypacks:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/162"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/dry-daypack.jpg" title="Sea to Summit Dry Daypack" alt="Sea To Summit Dry Daypack" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a lightweight bag that I could use day to day for carrying my camera and a
jacket, it’s water proof and it folds down into a tiny little sack roughly the
size of a tennis ball, so when I’m not using it, it would fit inside my main
bag easily.</p>

<p>It’s 3 weeks from now until departure&lt; day, and I think it’s looking like I
actually might meet my goal of fitting everything into 40 L. I’m not planning
on taking too many clothes and my trial pack on the weekend made my 70L
backpack look ridiculously large. I think I need to commit to the idea, get the
bag and start making sure everything fits as well as I hope it will.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The hardest part so far of packing my life into a bag and heading off for an
indefinite period has been trying to get rid of the huge amount of stuff I own.
A lot of the big/valuable stuff has been easy to let go of, and find buyers
for, but once you remove all that stuff from your life you’re left with a
massive amount of “little things”.</p>

<p>Individually, almost all of it is probably worth less an $50 an item; a lot of
it is probably not even worth $10 per piece. This makes it not worth trying to
sell most of it. But the sheer amount of stuff matching that description means
that it’s actually hard to let go of. Some of it had a story behind it, some of
it is just junk, but when you’ve got 200-300 odds and ends it ends up being a
few thousand dollars worth of stuff that you need to get rid of (no point
paying to store all that crap somewhere), but you pretty much cant sell.</p>

<p>From the masses of clothing, to the miscellaneous electronic/computer
cables/parts, medical supplies, doof survival gear, books, dvds… it all
basically adds up to stuff I barely use and wouldn’t miss if it was gone, but
accepting that it’s all going to waste is a little bit difficult, and seems to
be something I’m prolonging a lot longer than I should or need to. I’m
expecting that a week or two before I leave I’m going to have to have everyone
I know come over, go through all my stuff and take whatever they want,
otherwise I’m going to end up with a small skip worth of stuff that needs to
disappear so the next housemate can move in.</p>

<p>I’ve been finding it cathartic as each thing goes and my list of worldly
possessions gets shorter, but the getting rid of all the small, unimportant
stuff is definitely an out of proportion weight on my mind at the moment. I
guess maybe it’s me being a bit of a lazy hoarder, and letting it run unchecked
for too long. When I last moved house I intended to get rid of a bunch of stuff
because I was moving into a smaller room, but never got around to it. In the
end I waited it out until I was living in a much larger room and still failed
to get rid of much stuff until now.</p>

<p>I’m aiming to have little enough stuff I’m taking with me that I’ll be able to
fit into a 40L pack. I’m hoping I can get my life outside of that bag down to
maybe 1 or 2 50cm<sup>3</sup> boxes that I need to find homes for, but at this point that
seems like quite a challenge. Wish me Luck!</p>
