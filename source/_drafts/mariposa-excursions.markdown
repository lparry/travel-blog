While studying at La Mariposa I got to take advantage of a lot of free excursion
to cool places around Nicaragua. Here's a few of my favourites from the month
there.

Granada
=======

First stop for the day was the cemetery, where we saw the graves of a huge
number of young people who had died in the contra war. It was really sad to
think of how many young men never lived to see 20, fighting in that war. We
learnt that “burial” plots (most of which are actually chambers above ground)
are rented out, and when the family of the deceased can’t afford to pay anymore,
the body gets moved out so another one can take it's place.

We made a visit to a cigar factory and saw how the cigars are made, using 5
kinds of leaves and a press. It was quite impressive to see how quickly they
could roll one up, then finish it off in the press. One of the big fat cigars
and one of the thin ones were passed around for the group to try. I thought the
thin one was much nicer, but both left a terrible stale smoke taste in my mouth.

The cigar factor was also home to a huge scarlet macaw who was quite tame.
Andrei took this great photo with him on my shoulder.

We climbed up the bell tower of the old cathedral to look out over the city.
It gave a nice view of  one of the volcanos, and allowed you to see all the
colonial style court yards in many of the old houses.

went to the old convent, city burned by william what’s his name. model of the city, old nica artifacts


After lunch we took a boat ride out among the 365 islands surrounding Granada in
Largo Nicaragua. Some of them are tiny, while others are fairly sizable. There
were many, many houses out there, some very fancy holiday homes among them.

One of the islands is dubbed "monkey island". It is home to a number of
rehabilitated monkey, apparently put there by a vet. There were 3 spider monkeys
and a white faced one. The way the spider monkeys move is just like in the
cartoons, using their tail as if it were just a 5th arm. Apparently the monkeys
get fed regularly by the vet as the island does not grow food they eat. The
spider monkeys are quite curious and they all come out on the outer branches of
the trees and look at passing boats.

We stopped at a bar on one of the islands for a cold drink and a swim in the
lake. There was a sprung diving board which made for some fun jumping into the
lake, which was a beautiful temperature. Most of the time I'd spent in the water
prior to this had been in salt water, so it was interesting to see how much more
easily I sank in fresh water.

birthday cake for finn, frosting that was soft like cream, but way sweeter
piñata smashing! it turns out they make piñatas here out of ceramic. we had a small mission to keep the dogs from eating any candy or chocolate, but everything went smoothly and finn had a good time smashing the crap out of his piñata. Guilamette also seemed to enjoy it, I have a bad feeling she’s got some sort of disability :(


Vulcan Masaya
=============

One of the afternoon trips was to see an active volcano. It's not actually
Volcan Masaya, which is actually the dormant crater next to ????.

It's definitely the easiest volcano you can summit, with the car park being
right on the crater rim.

The day we visited it was pumping out a lot of cloudy gas; enough to block out
the sun. This also meant we couldn't see much in the volcano. I'm told that the
lava at the bottom is about 120°C, which sounds pretty hot, but another one in
Nicaragua is supposed to be 400°C and glow much more brightly.

We walked to a few different view points, then went up a nearby hill which
passed the dormant Masaya volcano.

We watched the sunset from the top of the hill, with the gases from the volcano
giving us beautiful oranges, purples and blues.

After sunset, we went to the mouth of a cave after sunset, where tons of bats
flying out to do their thing for the evening. It's amazing how fast they fly and
yet how rarely they collide with anything.

We put on safety hats and got torches, and went 180M down into another tunnel
which was formed by lava flow "recently" (800 years?). Pretty cool to see all
the blue volcanic stone and bubbles. Tree roots were creeping in from the
ceiling giving it a fantastical sort of feeling. When we reached the deepest
point in the cave that we would visit, we all turned off our torches breifly to
experience total darkness. Spoiler: it was black.
