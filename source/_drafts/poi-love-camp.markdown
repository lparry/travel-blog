Poi Love Camp was an 11 day retreat about spinning poi, held in Costa Rica being
run by Nick Woolsey, the man behind [PlayPoi](http://www.playpoi.com). Also
teaching there were one of my most inspirational spinners Jonathan Alvarez and
the amazingly talented Alien Jon. It'd been on my radar for a little while, but
it wasn't until a few days before Christmas when I decided that I needed to get
out of the European winter that I really seriously thought about going, and a
day later had bought flights and tickets to what ended up being one of the most
fun fortnights I've every had.

It was held at a property near [Cerro
Chirrip√≥](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Chirrip%C3%B3) called Finca Mia, a
beautiful eco-retreat up in the hills, with a pretty little river running
through the property.


Just about everyone stayed at a hotel in San Jose for a night on arrival to get
driven out to the site in a minivan the next day. It was mind-blowingly awesome
to come down for breakfast and find Nick, Jonathan and Jon all seated around a
table talking about poi. I was actually kind of star struck for most of the
first day and felt too intimated to actually even spin in front of those guys.

There was some pool side video making in the morning with Nick trying to spin
underwater, and generally getting to meet everyone there.

The minivan ride was lots of fun, everyone discussing how they got started
spinning, how long they'd been doing it etc. There were some great stories told,
but I think Jonathan's story telling abilities need a special mention, he's
nearly as good at story telling as he is at poi.

Every time the van would stop for any reason, people would jump out and start
spinning, to the amusement/confusion of the Ticos many of who'd never seen
anything like it.

When we arrived at Finca Mia I got lucky and got a cabin to myself called the
sunrise cabin. It only had 3 walls and a curtain for the fourth wall, facing the
direction that the sun rises. It was kind of surreal having a room that just
opened straight out into the forest!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327238376/in/set-72157645015360162" title="My cabin from below by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/14327238376_e163a315b8_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="My cabin from below"></a>

As the sun set loads of fireflies came out, which made the place feel like a
some sort of magic pixi-land with little glowing dots all along the pathways.
There was quite a lot of animal wild life on the property, loads of lizards,
hummingbirds, even an armadillo!

It was really nice getting to get to know everyone at camp. Everybody was very
friendly and approachable and after a few days it felt like I'd known these
people for a whole lot longer.

Days consisted of yoga first thing in the morning, followed by a very varied and
delicious organic breakfast and some time to chill or go for a quick swim.  I
stuck it out with the yoga for about a week before giving in and deciding my
calves and hamstrings are too tight for most of the poses these days. One day
I'll have to work on getting some flexibility back again.

Then we'd spend a few hours up on the yoga deck in the morning working on
various poi skills with a focus on getting the basics solid, timing, performance
and choreography.

Lunch would be another healthy buffet of great food, followed by a little more
free time in which I often took the chance to swim in the river. The water was a
little bit fresh but very refreshing when you're all hot and sweaty, and it was
lovely to warm up in the sun on the rocks afterwards.

In the afternoons we'd head back up to the yoga deck for more workshops, often
building on stuff from the morning, of practicing a choreographed piece that
Nick wanted to try and film.

Dinner would be another organic feast. One night we had soft-shell tacos and
they were pretty much the best tacos I've ever tasted

I learned loads of stuff in a short period, and became aware of a number of weak
spots in my poi basics that I need to work on. I've learned a lot things only
one direction, so while I can do a lot of different things I'm often limited in
what I can move between smoothly because I'm not comfortable with the direction
required to do so, so it's good to have realised that so I can go back to basics
for all the permutations to make everything flow a little more easily.

We did some good exercises about developing left/right independence. Sort of
like the old rubbing your tummy while patting your head, but on steroids. These
skills become really important for Hybrids where one hand traces out one pattern
while the other traces out a different one, creating some very beautiful
tracers.

A lot of time was spent on footwork techniques to turn more smoothly and with
less effort, and spotting when turning to reduce dizziness when repeatedly
turning in the same direction. This seems to be stuff that dancers have very
little trouble with but having never really learnt to dance I found quite
difficult. Thankfully a little bit of practice has improved things a lot but I
still need to work on this a lot.

We did some work on counting different things to fit patterns to music better.
Counting downbeats feels really natural to most people, but doing so means that
most patterns repeat on an odd number, which when put to 4/4 music makes things
complicated; for something like a 4 petal flower with 3 down beats you're stuck
repeating it 4 times over 3 bars before they line up again. While I can follow
the theory about this stuff, I struggled really hard to actually find the beat a
lot of the time. I know people joke about having no rhythm, but it honestly
feels like the part of my brain that should help with this is seriously
underdeveloped.

Nick had a set of pixel poi at the retreat which he was kind enough to let me
have a go of. From the first time I saw these on a video on Youtube I was in
awe, and then when I saw the price I was in even more awe. Getting to actually
spin them was amazingly, fun and kind of disorienting (they're super bright),
but also kind of terrifying. I'm sure they're probably pretty tough, but the
though of having to pay for them if they got broken meant I was probably more
worried spinning them than I've ever been with fire.

Jon and Jonathan brought along a lot of (at the time) not-yet-for-sale Flowtoys
products which we all got to play around with. Lots of stuff from the new
modular capsule line-up, capsule handles, compact capsule flower-cap poi, dual
capsule tube poi, even capsule staffs! The capsule handles are so nice I'm
pretty much converted to the idea of lit up handles, and I really liked the
compact flower-cap poi.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350320165/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Hot springs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5571/14350320165_c6a9d0c105_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hot springs"></a>

We made a couple of excursions out into the local area. One day we made a visit
to the nearby hot springs. There's natural warm water coming down the hill, but
it's been routed into some concrete pools to make the bodies of water big enough
to really swim it. It was a very relaxing way to spend a few hours just hanging
out enjoying the water.

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DPQi4KNHonM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

We got invited to come along to a local festival and rodeo where the group
performed in the bull ring with LED poi. The crowd loved it and some people were
even actually asking afterwards about getting the group to perform at other
events. It was my first time in front of a big crowd and it was heaps of fun.

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6n_n9iDN5Do?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

After the performance Jonathan decided he wanted to spin poi in the ring with
the bulls. The locals weren't so keen on him doing this, but they he was able to
partner up with a local guy who was shitfaced drunk, and tried to tie up a baby
bull. The guy had somehow miscommunicated that Jonathan should try and tie up
the bull's back legs up while the local guy grabbed it around the neck, which
lead to some hilarious attempts to get it tied up while the announcer heckled
him in Spanish.

One morning some of us made a visit to the local chocolate maker in the village.
It was run by a lady named Tao, who showed us how they made their chocolate,
grinding the cocoa beans in a juicer with some cocoa butter, then put in another
thing that rolled the chocolate over for 3 days to get it silky smooth. We then
got to take a batch from 3 days ago and make our own blocks of chocolate with
our own choice of added flavourings.  I made mine with crushed coffee beans,
chilli flakes and sea salt. It turned out really tasty and didn't last long
after I started eating it.

Another day the whole group took a trip to a nearby beach for the day, Playa
Dominical. We had a nice lunch when we arrived, then went out in the surf and
did some body surfing. It was heaps of fun and reminded me how much I enjoy the
ocean. We had our afternoon poi class by the shore, then had dinner at a local
restaurant before making the trip back to the finca.

We had two nights of spinning fire right at the end of the retreat, as we had
some issues getting our hands on suitable fuel to burn. It was the first time
I'd spun with fire since way back in Thailand, so I was a little timid about it
and only felt up to spinning the first night, but it was great to see everyone
else busting out their best performances. Especially enjoyable were Thomas
spinning like a mad man to some crazy French psy-trance, and AlienJon's
beautifully synchronized slow swinging pendulums to an Ott song. 

After everything was done and dusted I hung around at Finca Mia for an extra few
days afterwards. It was sad to see the group diminish but great to get to spend
some extra time with the others who stayed on.
