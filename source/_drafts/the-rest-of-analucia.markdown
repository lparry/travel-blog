Next stop in Andalusia was a town named Córdoba that's claim to fame is the
Mezquita, a Mosque-Cathedral. I arrived in the evening and explored around a
bit, finding the town to be almost completely deserted but did take some nice
photos of this Roman era bridge and tower.

<!-- more -->

The Internet tells you you should try and get to the Mezquita early in the
morning so you can get photos without all the crowds, but the Internet doesn't
factor in not being able to get to sleep until 5am in the morning so I got up
around noon and went and had lunch for breakfast, a dish with ox tail that was
extremely nice.

After I'd eaten I headed over to the courtyard outside the Mezquita, a huge open
space full of orange trees. In fact, all of Córdoba is pretty well decked out in
them; they seem to be a very common decorative plant in Andalusia.

I actually peeled one and tried it, and let me tell you: it tasted terrible.
The oranges on these trees are incredibly bitter and unpleasant. I asked someone
about it later to find out if maybe they just weren't ripe yet, but it turns out
they're just not the eating kind. I didn't even know there were not-eating
oranges. That person thought they might even be toxic to humans, so it's lucky
they taste awful enough that I spat out my first bite.

Anyhow, I paid my admission and went into the Mezquita and it seemed that
afternoon was the perfect time for a visit. The place was nearly deserted,
giving me a chance to get a bunch of "postcard" shots without tour groups
cluttering them up.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14106540995/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Endless arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14106540995_369781e1f5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Endless arches"></a>

The building is absolutely massive, probably 150-200 Meters long and the same
again wide, and decked out with hundreds of columns, all topped with candy cane
coloured arches. It's very picturesque!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083005976/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally. by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/14083005976_3ac0d2bd9a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally."></a>

The building was actually originally built as a mosque, and is apparently
regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture.
Córdoba was later captured from the Moors by a Catholic king so the building was
converted into a Catholic cathedral, adding many Christian features to the
building and converting the minaret into a bell tower.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919575399/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Giant renaissance cathedral nave by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/13919575399_bf03ff09f1_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Giant renaissance cathedral nave"></a>

There was also this epic double organ with things up either side of the nave
(let's hope I'm using that word right, I saw it on Wikipedia but didn't care
enough to actually read the article), with pipes jutting out that made me think
of crazy drag-racing car exhausts.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919678087/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Organ pipes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/13919678087_789b8871e3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Organ pipes"></a>

After I'd taken 50 billion photos of arches I started playing around with my
camera settings and super long exposure shots to let me get some low ISO photos
with the fairly low lighting. A tripod would have been awesome, but I don't own
one and they specifically disallow them there, so I made do with putting the
camera on various ledges.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083226416/in/set-72157644463351646" title="I'm a ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14083226416_b46cff9418_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="I'm a ghost!"></a>

After doing a few I had the idea of running into the shot part way through the
exposure and standing still like a stature to try and get a transparent
ghost-like effect.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919732469/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Double ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5555/13919732469_29bbd66bbb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Double ghost!"></a>

I then tried doing even longer exposure shots and running around stopping in multiple
places so I could be in the same photo two or more times, no Photoshop required!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14103168651/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Ghosts cast no shadow by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5271/14103168651_c3a3462bc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ghosts cast no shadow"></a>

I probably ended up spending more time messing around with crazy ideas for
photos than I did actually looking around the Mezquita. I had heaps of fun
figuring out what worked, and I think some of them turned out pretty awesome if
I do say so myself.

After Córdoba I got one of the speedy Renfe trains to Seville. A little digital
display in the train told me we were going 250km/hour, but it was still
wonderfully smooth and quite the whole time. I wish we had decent trains back
home in Australia.

I went on yet another free walking tour, led by a student from Columbia. The
tour itself was alright, but everyone on the tour seemed to be travelling in
groups of 2-4 and there wasn't much inter-mingling so it didn't feel very social
compared to some of the tours that I've really enjoyed.

I'd heard from [Amanda and Luke](http://herecomestheplanet.com) that Seville doesn't
really live up to it's reputation and I have to agree. Nothing we visited on the
tour really stood out for me, so here's a token photo of Plaza de España with
all the water drained out.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921314810/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Plaza de España by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7413/13921314810_d89de7e826_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Plaza de España"></a>

They did however recommend a fancy tapas place called [La
Azotea](http://laazoteasevilla.es/) which was absolutely fantastic. I had some
smoked cheese, cooked wild mushrooms, and pork cheek; and all of it was amazing.
It was hands down the nicest tapas I came across; so good that I came back again
for dinner the same day.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14jk128073893/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Alcázar of Seville by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7039/14128073893_295d0227fd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Intricate carved archway in the Alcázar of Seville"></a>

I did get a tip from the tour guide that if I only visited once place, that the
Alcázar should be it, so after some difficulty actually locating it (Seville is
like a maze in the old area) I checked it out.

* Headed out to find the Alcazar, the palace of Seville, rain beginning to
  drizzle
* Alcázar is a stunning building, lots of parts from lots of different periods
* really starting to appreciate the arabic style of decoration, where their
  religion prohibits them from creating a likeness of things, so they have lots
  of geometric patterns and carvings
* lots of beautiful court yards, and huge gardens outside, but the rain stopped
  me from exploring the gardens much

* Head out to explore a bit after dark, find the mushroom parasol thingy is open
  so go up and have a look and take some photos

* Went and had churros con chocolate for breakfast


  Malaga

* Checked in, got some afternoon snacks and a huge 1L beer, then sat down and
  booked flights and stuff to go to Poi Love camp in Costa Rica. Super exciting!
* Hostel had a thing on where you could watch their cook making Paella then get
  to eat it for 5€. Met some nice people in the hostel, Lisa from Switzerland,
  Annika from Germany and Joni from Finland.
* Went out for drinks with those guys and ended up at a pub trivia thing. A
  friend of Annika's, Lilia and her brother Thomas also came along
* End up going out in search of a place with €0.40 beers that Lilia saw, fail to
  find it, probably closed
* Find a place where we can get budweiser for €1.5, so we all have a beer and
  wander around in some busy squares before calling it a night.
* Got home to find the other german girl from my room outside the door, the
  alcoholic in our room had “wet” one of the other beds and was now sleeping in
  yet another bed, so she didn't want to be in there alone with him. we went to
  reception and both go moved to another room. fucking crazy people.


* came down and had bacon and eggs for breakfast, it's nice staying somewhere
  with a cook even if you have to pay for it
* went on a free walking tour, Annika came along too.
* Run by an Australian girl Natalie, who's sisters Vanessa and Shelly were
  visiting from where they live in London. They also had a dutch-belgian friend
  Karyn and were all really lovely. Also a french-belgian girl named zoeie who
  was nice as well. A bit funny really, I was the only guy on the tour at all.
* The tour was good, went around Málaga and showed us the sites. I was probably
  a bit more interested in socialising. Felt nice to be a bit outgoing and get
  to know the people on the tour.
* went out for some Tapas & paella with the Vanessa aussie girls (it was Natalies
  birthday) and their begian friend
* After 2 beers, it was getting a bit late in the afternoon so I headed off by
  myself to find a park and practice the poi basics I need to have sorted by
  January. Put on glitch mob and spun for about an hour. started to get reverse
  thread the needle, still troubled by reverse butterfly with right hand on top,
  but surprisingly I felt like some of the stuff I was struggling with last time
  I spun had sorted itself out. maybe I just needed time to digest the new
  knowledge
* went to room and lay down and slept for a little bit, then went down and found
  Annika and made plans for the evening with her.
* met up with Annika and Ivi from Canada, Toronto, went out and had dinner at
  some divey little place near the port
* Lilla and Thomas came and caught up with us again
* went out for drinks at the 0.40€ beer place

* Go up to the castle
* long walk up the hill, thankfully mostly in the shade
* sat and rested at a nice lookout overlooking the sea
* got to the castle at 2pm and was happy to find out that it's free admission
  from 2pm on Sundays
* castle was nice and peaceful, triangle topped wall thingies probably done by
  the moors
* came back to the hostel, chilled for a little bit then met up with Annika and
  an American guy from Idaho, went out for beer and tapas. Delicious cuttlefish
  cubes

* sorted bag out a bit and worked out what I want to mail home. Bye bye zoom
  lens, bye awesome patchwork jacket
* went to post office and mailed home camera lens and Granada hoodie
* went and had churros con chocolate at a place that had been open pretty much
  forever, so delicious
