My bags are packed, almost all my things are sold/donated/given away. Tomorrow
morning I get up early to head to the airport, say good bye to Melbourne and fly
off to Vietnam to start my trip.

I'm feeling a mixture of excitement, sadness, terror and exhaustion. It's been a
busy week sorting out the last of my things and catching up with people for the
last time. The past 3 days I've been doing stuff pretty much non-stop; now I
finally get to sit down and not feel like there's something else I need to be
doing.

It's going to be different not being able to regularly see and hang out with
people I've known for more than a few days. I'm hoping that with practice I get
better at small talk and meeting new people, so maybe that'll be less of an
issue.

I guess there's not much more I can do right now, but strap in and wait for this
wild ride to start...
