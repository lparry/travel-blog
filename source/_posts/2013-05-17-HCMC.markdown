On my first morning in Vietnam I woke, packed my stuff in my private room into my bags and checked out to walk 30M around the corner to the dorm style accommodation I have booked for the rest of my stay here. I wasnt able to check in until 1pm, so I left my big bag and took just my day pack with all the valuable stuff in it. Even with just a tiny laptop and an MFT system camera, valuables still weigh a ton.

I went out onto the main road to try some delicious baked goods from the bakery recommended to me by the first hostel. They had some pretty tasty stuff, but the place was a big franchise and felt very much like Breadtop back home. I sat outside eating my coffee bun and croissant and a little older Vietnamese lady who was there eating started to talk to me. She asked me where I was from, how long I had been travelling, etc. Then she offered me a massage. I could already see where this was going and told her no, but just in case I had missed her meaning she repeated she would give me massage and "boom boom". At 10am. At a franchise bakery. It seems that being a single male in Vietnam leads to the locals assuming you're a sex tourist.

Got breakfast at the bakery, propositions for a massage and "bang bang"... at 10am
went to ben than market, looked very briefly. not buying anything, sick of being hasseled to look at crap and having stuff shoved in my face
walked some more, kept getting hasseled by motor cycle tour guides
ho chi mihn museum, massive palace with underground bunker
too hot, went into fancy shopping center looking for somewhere to break stupid 500000 dong notes. ate some fresh spring rolls, pork, eggs and broken rice (seemed ok to me?)
ate an ice cream, seseme and tapicoa
typed up diary for yesterday
came back, checked in, sorted through my stuff and started chucking out stuff. packaging, travel clothes.
went for a massage at the HCMC blind society
bought some fruit, no idea what it is
grabbed poi and went to the park over the road, gathered a crowd in all of about 5 minutes, after 10 I was dripping with sweat and stopped
talked to a vietnamese student for about an hour, asking lots of questsions, practicing his english
went out for dinner at some generic place, headed to a bakery for desert

Day 2

Cu Chi tunnels
Guide was very interesting a half-Filipino, half Vietnamese guy who fought in the war on the USA side. he'd had a horrific life, his wife and mother killed in the war. told us most of what both sides said was the way things happened was bullshit.

Watch a video that was so nationalistic/anti-american it was painful to watch. I'm not a huge supporter of americans but they went on and on about people being heros for killing americans and it was a bit much.

saw the size of the geniune entreances, and a manhole, crazy small. saw the leg traps, very vicious.
Went to the shooting range, fired 10 shots with an AK-47. for a reliable rifle, the one I had seemed to keep fucking up. having seen the youtube fps russian slather one in bacon and icecream I can only assume the one i shot was crazy old and should be reitired.

Went down into the enlarged tourist tunnels. To be honest they were bigger than I expected. I thought we'd be forced to crawl on our hands and knees but we could walk bent over at the waist pretty ok. there was one tight spot that required hands and knees. I guess in the real ones someone my size would have gone hands and knees all the time, and gotten stuck at the choke points.

bus ride home, dull.

went down the street, had some beers at a cheap ass beer bar. bought some tiny little boiled eggs from a lady with some dipping sauce, very tasty, no idea what bird they were from.

had dinner at some place recommended on trip advisor, was ok, but only had westerners eating there so either the food was bad or overpriced. I notice more and more how much american tastes and expectations differ from other western countries and wish that there was a way to filter out their reviews. A lot of what they consider to be delicious appears to be stuff that I'd consider pretty gross.

delicous waffles

fancy swedish massage.

day 3

breakfast across the lane again
took first motorbike taxi, fun, cheap and fast, plus the breeze is cooling. why have I been walking like a schmuck!?
war museum, interesting but not catered to someone who knows sweet fuck all about history. Lots of stuff about the specifics that happened, but little about the motives of either side. Lots of stuff about the after effects of agent orange on people of both sides, but I needed to look up it up online to find it was a herbiside being sprayed to kill off all the vegitation.
screaming school group. the same in any language. Constant barage of kids saying hello to me, was like being famous, probably equally annoying.
reunification palace, interesting bunker below full of comms and crypto gear. 
got a cyclo from reunification palace to notre dame by a very old man. it was a bit of a laugh, but very slow compared to motorbikes and very hot in the sun. He was pretty stubborn that he'd take me to the next place after that, but I bailed and got a motorbike.
Went up the bitexco building observation deck, great view of the city. one patch seemed oddly undeveloped, photos showed more houses there than there were today, mostly scrub-land. apparently that's the site for the new business district. expected to be completed in 15 years. it would be amazing to come back and see the area filled with skyscrapers, having seen it looking like scrub.
Met up with a nice Saigon local, Trinh, thkat I meet through OK Cupid. took me for a ride on her motorbike, went to a park and sat and had a vietnamese coffee and talked for a while, answering a lot of the questions I'd wondered about things in Vietnam. Then went to a pho bo bar, and had some pho, this time with more instruction as to how to eat it. much better thsi time around, but I still think I'm a bigger fan of non-soup dishes.

rested at home, crazy heavy rain.
drank beer at the hostel talkign with an american guy who just arrived from cambodia, got some tips for where to stay when I get there. rain eased up so I headed out and got some pork buns and some other buns I thought were supposed to be beef, but had a sweet paste in them.
early night

got up before 7 again
decided to try breakfast soemwhere else again, walked over towards the markets, stopping a few times along the way to have coffee, buy some tropical fruit (mangostein), etc. took some photos of the sight and scenes of saigon.

sat in the shade at the park, had another woman solicit me for a massage and boom boom. being a single guy in asia gets all sorts of unwanted attention. fucking sex tourists have made it a lot less pleasant for the rest of us.

had a guy coem and tell me my thongs needed cleaning. I told him no, please dont. I dont want you to clean my shoes but he was insistent and got down with his brush near my shoes. I pulled my feet away and accidentially knee'd him in the head I got up and quickly crossed the street and headed down the alley way my hostel is in.

to recover from such an incident, I wandered down the lane and saw one of the legit spa/massage places and decided that I'd get my nails done, since they were pretty gross from trying to get into the mangostein and I'd never had it done before. It cost a whole $2.50, which I assume is cheap for a manicure and pedicure. the ladies working there were greatly amused when I asked for it. my nails are now nicely clipped and cuticules and stuff removed, but there are 2-3 spots where they clipped too closely that have bled a little. Not sure if I should be worried about that or not :S
