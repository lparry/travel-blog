after that I went back to the hostel, packed my things, said goodbye to my roommates, checked out and got a taxi. compared to getting a taxi from the airport, getting one there was easy as pie. I walked to the street, determined not to pay more than the fixed price taxis, had a guy cross the street and ask me where I was going. I told him and asked him how much and he offered me 20k less than what I was hoping to get the ride for off the bat so I accepted it without haggling. He entertained me along the drive telling me all sorts of stuff in broken english (including "fuck you" to the police as we drove past) so I ended up tipping him.

When I got to the airport none of the normal desks for vietnam airlines were open, only business class & VIP. Luckily for my I treated myself to business class since it was only $30 more than economy and I'd never flown business before. So I got to go straight up and check in, headed through security and into the business class lounge in which I got some free food and a bunch of drinks and got to sit in a comfortable chair and use free wifi in a nice peaceful environment as opposed to the noisy ass airport where it looked like I would have needed to fight to get even just a hard uncomfortable chair.

When they called boarding I got to skip the line and walk straight on and sit down. I noticed that in business class on vietnam airlines none of the normal rules seem to get applied to you. The did the usual announcement about bags going in the overhead locker or under the seat in front. I had no seat in front but wanted to get some stuff out before the flight so I sat down and did so, leaving the bag in front of my expecting them to come and tell me it needed to be stowed, but they didnt care. I was using my phone camera to take some photos as we took off and they didnt bother me about it (in fact, I saw one of the hostess' using their phone during take-off too.

We got up in the air, they came around and gave business class drinks and pretty much straight away the captain did the "prepare the cabin for landing" announcement (yeah, the flight was that short :P). Looking around business class it was funny watching all these people who'd got a beer struggling to chug them down quickly.

we got off the plane and were put on a bus, which then basically did a u-turn and stopped in front of the terminal 30-40M away. I could have easily walked there in less time than I spent waiting on the bus if I'd realised that's where it was going.

business class bags were already on the carosel so I grabbed mine and went to leave but at the door there was a woman checking that ticket stubs matched up to the bag you had. I ended up having to empty my bag to find the ticket stub; it's honestly lucky I even had it, I often leave them on the plane. NFI what would have happened then?
