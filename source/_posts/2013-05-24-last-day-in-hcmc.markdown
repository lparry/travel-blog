For my final morning in Saigon I got up and ventured out north in search of something different for breakfast than the noodles and mystery meat I'd been having. I stopped along the way a few times to sit in tiny plastic chairs with the locals and drink iced coffee while the traffic did it's crazy thing. I ended up buying a half kilo of mangostein for breakfast with which I made a huge mess before the owner of one of the coffee stand I was sitting at came over with a knife and helped me out. Ugly fruit, but so very tasty.

I sat in the shade at the park for a bit and had another woman solicit me for a massage and "boom boom". Being a single guy in Asia gets all sorts of unwanted attention. Sex tourists have made it a lot less pleasant for the rest of us.

Later while sitting in the same spot I had a guy come and tell me my thongs needed cleaning. I told him no, please don't. I dont want you to clean my shoes but he was very insistent and got down with his brush near my feet. I pulled my foot away and accidentally kneed him in the head, after which I got up and quickly crossed the street and rushed away down the alley way my hostel is in.

To recover from such an incident, I stumbled into one of the legit spa/massage places and decided that I'd get my nails done, since they were pretty gross from trying to get into the mangostein and I'd never had a manicure done before. It cost a whole $2.50, which I assume is cheap for a manicure and pedicure. The ladies working there were greatly amused when I asked for it. My nails are now nicely clipped and cuticles and stuff removed, but there are 2-3 spots where they clipped too closely that have bled a little. Not sure if I should be worried about that or not :S

After that it was time to grab my bags head to the airport.
