Arrived late with an airport transfer, the roads of india didnt seem too crazy at that time of night, or at least no worse than Vietnam or Cambodia. Checked into the hotel, shown up to my room. straight to sleep that night.

woke the next day and went out in search of an ATM so I could get some Rupees and some breakfast. The ATM was easy enough, although the max withdrawal was less than AUD$200, another win for my overseas fee free credit card. I'd hate to be getting socked with $5-10 foriegn ATM fees for every $200 I needed.

Breakfast wasnt so easy to find. The area the hotel was in, Karol Barg, seemed to be mostly closed, which seemed a bit annoying in a country where it's so hot to be shut for the coolest part of the day. A persistant "guide" and his auto-rickshaw driver finally wore me down after following me for about 15 minutes while I walked and failed to find anywhere open with food. They took me to a south indian street food place where I had dosa and vegetable curry, which was actually really good, so I decided to stick with them for a while. That turned out to be a mistake, they took me to a shitty "handi-craft" market.

maybe it wasnt shitty, but I just honstely dont give two shits about handi-crafts, and even less so about stuff so generic that you could say it was from anywhere in south east asia. I did a quick walk through, still trying to be polite at this point, but really just wanted to get out of there. I went back out to the rickshaw and asked them to take me to a real market, you know, with like the baskets of spice and stuff that might make nice photos. The drove me to another shitty tourist shop (writing market on your sign doesnt make it a market), I was getting fed up with it at this point and didnt even get out of the tuk tuk and asked to be taken somewhere I could have a chai. They instead took me to the tourist travel agent to get a free map, which the guy inside told me cost 500 rupees, so I left empty handed. The rickshaw then took me to "a great place for tea", which was another air conditioned tourist shop selling dried tea. I got fed up and told the guide to stop wasting both our time with tourist traps as I was flat out not interested, take me to the sort of place where he would actually drink chai of a morning. I think he got a bit pissy but the rickshaw driver seemed to get it and walked with me down the street 100m to a little hole in the wall where we had tiny little cups of chai masala. it was very yummy, but the shot size plastic cups were not exactly satisfying
