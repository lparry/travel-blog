first day, saumi. dodgy moto taxi that overshot lemai significantly. rain storm. 
lazy day at the resort, lemai repaired my opinion of samui significantly. lots of germans? met welsh ex-pat couple, complained about the heat even though I thought it was cool compared to cambodia.
ferry to koh tao, horrible time finding _any_ accomodation. didnt realise at the time, due to full moon party the weekend before. fuck full moon parties. initial feels about the place were that it had changed, not in a good way. first hotel called itself a resort, but was only half finished and very overpriced. room hardly furnished, no screens on the windows of a fan room. went and met rolf who runs the koh tao central hostel, got a quick tour of the hostel which was significantly cheaper than where I was, air conditioned, newly built (so everything is working and clean) and actually offered the chance to meet people. booked in for the next available night.

had a drink and wrote some stuff in a bar over the road. a pretty girl I later got to know as Liane sparked up a converstaion and I found out she was diving with crystal, where I originally got certified. she asked about accomodation, planning where she'd stay after the free accom from the course ran out, and I gave the hostel a plug. later after she'd left, rolf from the hostel came over and had a beer, wanting to know how I'd found out about the hostel and if I had any ideas for the place. Apparently it only opened a few weeks earlier, and he was quite keen to make it a success so he was asking for feedback pretty much everytime I saw him.

started diving with master divers, the no. 1 rated outfit on tripadvisor. priced a bit high, but the price comes down retrospectively the more dives you do with them. The staff there were lovely, but because they were a small shop and it was low season the boats only go out once a day, and mostly to open water suitable sites (almost nothing deeper than 18M)
