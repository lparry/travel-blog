SERENGETI

So the main draw card for visiting Tanzania was in fact not to go and laze about Zanzibar, rather it was to go and visit the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, some of Africa's best known big game parks.

We left our overland truck behind and divided off into a number of Landrovers with just enough clothing and food for the few days we'd be in the parks.

To get into the Serengeti we needed to drive up over the rim of the crater (but not into the crater), past where we would be camping the following night. As we drove up the temperature dropped quite noticeably, and at the top we stopped at a lookout point where there was a pretty spectacular view of the crater. We then desended down another side of the crater and into the Serengeti.

It had been very dry for quite some time apparently, which meant that vehicles going in and out kicked up heaps and heaps of dusk. A lot of the dirt leading up to the Serengeti park entrance was a very rich red, which made some beautiful vistas where you'd have a pale green and yellow hill with a bright red line cut through it, with an almost painted looking red gradient fading down hill of the road for 10-15M and a few meters uphill of it. It's hard to really describe it well with words, so here's a photo!

Anyhow, on our first day in the Serengeti we saw a ton of stuff. Not long after we got into the main part of the park we passed 4-5 lions sleeping, which had surprisingly few other vehicles stopped around them. In these parks you often seem to find the big 5 by just looking for the clusters of 4WDs.

That is actually how we found two leopards sleeping in trees, so far from the road you couldn't see them with the naked eye. All the stopped vehicles got us to stop and try and work out what they were looking at, and then through binoculars you could make them out lying in the forks of trees and see their tail hanging down.

Of course we saw a whole lot of the more common stuff too. We had a small herd of elephants that were approaching the road and walked right passed our Land Rover less than a few meters away. There were several hyenas roaming about, heaps and heaps of Grant's and Thompson's gazelles, a few heart beasts, and a lot of lovably ugly warthogs.

That night we actually camped in the Serengeti. They do have dedicated camp areas there, but don't get the wrong impression. There are no fences and you really are camping out in the wild. We were instructed to set up out tents with a few meters gap between them, just in case elephants or hippos came through so that they'd have enough room to pass rather than just walking straight over tents; and not long before bed several people saw a hyena shaped silhouette with lit up eyes from the torchlight. Sadly, being a heavy sleeper, I slept through any animal sounds that may or may not have been made that night.

We were instructed that if we woke up in the middle of the night and heard noises, to just stay in out tents and be quiet, and don't turn on any lights. If you need to go to the toilet, hold it. If you cant hold it, wake up your tent buddy, shine a torch outside the tent looking for eyes, then go right there next to the tent while your buddy keeps watch and deal with it in the morning. I was glad to be someone who very rarely needs to get up in the middle of the night!

We were up well before sunrise the next day for one of the major trip highlights, hot air ballooning over the Serengeti! We were collected in 4WDs and driven to the site where they where getting things set up. It was interesting to see how they inflate the balloons with huge fans to start off with the basket on it's side. They then squeeze everyone into their compartments while it's still on it's side and you feel a bit like an astronaut about to blast off to the moon, lying flat to the ground looking up towards the moon in the still dark sky.

The burners begin getting fired and the balloon slowly rises, eventually tipping the basket upright. The actual take-off was so gentle you don't even feel the balloon lift off, just all of a sudden you're no longer on the ground and moving. It's very surreal very surreal.

Each balloon held 16 passengers and a pilot, and there were three balloons going up that morning. Our group was 15 people and we ended up getting a balloon to ourselve!

During the balloon flight we saw our first hippos of the Serengeti, probably 20-30 of them concentrated in the water and dashing about nearby. From the roads the park feels like a completely flat and dry, yellow savannah; but from the air you see the gashes of green carved through the yellow where the waterways runs through, and there's actually quite a lot of animal activity in and around these parts.

We got to see the sun rise from the air, after which the balloon started casting a nice shadow silhouette on the ground.

As we flew further over the park we passed over a few lioness' and one very majestic male lion with a huge big mane who just sort of looked up at us, wondering what the heck we were I guess.

Most of the animals didn't seem to pay us much attention although we did manage to startle some buffalo when we were flying quite low, firing the burners caused them to look up suddenly and then dash off a short distance before realising we weren't a threat. At one point we were gliding so low that the basket actually skimmed over the top of an Acacia.

Just as we were landing we spotted a hyena chasing down a gazelle. Everyone was pretty disappointed to be told we had to get back into the take off position for safety, where we were unable to keep watching. The landing was very smooth; not quite as unnoticeable as the take off, but still hardly a bump or drag along the ground and we were stopped on the ground, upright and everything. Our pilot had mad skills!

Upon landing we had a Champagne breakfast and were told the entertaining story about French ballooning pioneers, which rather than reinterpret I'll quote here:

<p class="quote">The creation of the hot air balloon dates back to the 1700s, and the first flight occurred on Oct. 19, 1783 in France.</p>

<p class="quote">In 18th century France, there were educated people living in the city and there were landowners and peasants in the country. People in the rural areas often had little contact and connection to what was going on in the city.</p>

<p class="quote">So, picture this, you are a peasant working in the fields and all of the sudden you see this balloon floating through the air with fire coming out of it. Is it an alien? An attacker? For peasants who hadn’t heard of hot air ballooning,  the sight of a balloon falling from the sky surprised and often frightened them; especially when they saw the pilot’s face covered in black from ash and soot from the fire keeping the balloon aloft.</p>

<p class="quote">To avoid being attacked by the people they surprised, hot air balloon pilots carried Champagne or wine with them as a way to let onlookers know they were human and to thank them for the safe landing in their field.</p>

So there you have it, Champagne is the way to settle down rowdy French farmers when you're trespassing on their property!

The breakfast was very fancy, even by western standards. As we approached the tables there was a guy with a basin and a jug of warm water who'd pour it so you could wash your hands, and them dry them with a real cotton towel! The table settings wouldn't have been at all out of place in a fancy restaurant, and as we got closer I could smell my old friend bacon, sizzling away somewhere.

Having not had bacon since leaving home, I would have been happy if they'd served me just a plate of bacon, but there were eggs, sausages, fruit, coffee and juice... It was like a real English breakfast and then some!

To make the day even better, when we got back to camp Charles had make us pancakes and bacon for brunch! Could a day be any more perfect!?!

KENYA POST
crossing into kenya, trouble getting the truck in. make lunch at the border. start playing cricket at the border, drew a crowd of truck drivers watching and trying to catch long shots.

3 options, leave the truck, pay a bond for the value of the truck (bond that you dont get back, luckly the truck is on the books as being worth $4k, instead of the 100K+ it would be worth) or pay a bribe

eventually we were able to pay a bribe of $300 to get the paperwork fudged.
