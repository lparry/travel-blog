SERENGETI

main reason for visiting Tanzania was to visit the Serengeti National Park, and the Ngorongoro Crater

drove up onto the rim of the crater, noticably cooler, pretty spectacular view, desended down (still outside the crater) into the Serengeti. it was very dry, which emant lots of dust, which made some beautiful vistas where you'd have a green and yellow landscape, with a red dirt road cut through it that painted a nice red gradient fading down wind of the road. it's hard to put into words so here's a photo.

Anyhow, on our first day in the Serengeti we saw a ton of stuff. Not long after we got into the main part of the park we passed 4-5 lions sleeping, which had surprisingly few other vehicles stopped around them. in these parks you generally seem to find the big game by looking for the clusters of jeeps. this is how we found two leopards sleeping in trees, so far from the road you couldnt see them with the naked eye, but through binoculars you could make them out and see their tail hanging down.

Of course we saw a bunch of the more common stuff, a small herd of elephants that were approaching the road and walked right passed out jeep less than a few meters away, several hyeenas, many many gazzelles, heart beasts, warthogs

That night we camped in the Serengeti. They do have dedicated camps, but dont get the wrong impression, there are no fences and you really are camping in the wild. we were instructed to set up out tents with a few meters gap between them incase elephants came through so they'd have room to pass rather than just walking over tents, and not long before bed several people saw a hyeena shaped silluette with lit up eyes from the torchlight.

we were told that if we woke up in the middle of the night and heard noises, to just stay in out tents and be quite, dont turn on any lights. if you need to go to the toilet, hold it. if you cant hold it, wake up your tent buddy, shine a torch outside the tent looking for eyes, then go right there next to the tent. I'm glad to be someone who rarely gets up in the middle of the night.

We were up well before sunrise the next day for one of the trip highlights, hot air ballooning over the serengeti! It was interesting to see how they inflate the ballons with huge fans to start off with the basket on it's side. the squeeze everyone in while it's on it's side and you feel like an astronaught about to blast off to the moon, looking up towards the still dark sky. the burners start getting fired adn the ballon rises, eventually tipping the basket upright. the actual takeoff is so gentle you dont even feel take off, just all of a sudden your off the ground and moving, very surreal. 

We saw our first hippos in the serengeti, 20-30 of them in the water and dashing about nearby. from the roads the place feels like a completely dry, yellow savana; but from the air you see gashes of green where the water runs through, and there's a lot of animal activity in and around these parts.

We also flew over 2-3 lioneses and one very majestic male lion with a huge big mane who just sort of looked up at us, wondering what the heck we were I guess.

We did manage to startle some buffalo when we were flying quite low, firing the burners causes them to look up quickly before dashing off a short distance before realising we werent a threat. At one point we were so low that the basket skimmed over the top of an Acacia.

Just as we landed there was a hyeena chasing down a gazzelle. everyone was pretty disappointed to be told to squat down for safety, where we couldnt keep watching. the landing was very smooth; not quite as unnotiable as the takeoff, but still barely a bump or drag along the ground and we were stopped. Our pilot had mad skills!

Upon landing we had a champange breakfast and were told the entertainign story about french balloning pioneers, which rather than reinterpret I'll quote here:

  The creation of the hot air balloon dates back to the 1700s, and the first flight occurred on Oct. 19, 1783 in France.

  In 18th century France, there were educated people living in the city and there were landowners and peasants in the country. People in the rural areas often had little contact and connection to what was going on in the city.

  So, picture this, you are a peasant working in the fields and all of the sudden you see this balloon floating through the air with fire coming out of it. Is it an alien? An attacker? For peasants who hadn’t heard of hot air ballooning,  the sight of a balloon falling from the sky surprised and often frightened them; especially when they saw the pilot’s face covered in black from ash and soot from the fire keeping the balloon aloft.

  To avoid being attacked by the people they surprised, hot air balloon pilots carried Champagne or wine with them as a way to let onlookers know they were human and to thank them for the safe landing in their field.

The breakfast was incredibly fancy, even by western standards. As we approached the tables there was a guy with a basin and a jug of warm water who'd pour it so you could wash your hands, and them dry them with a real cotton towel! The table settings wouldnt have been at all out of place in a fancy restaunt, and as we got closer I could smell my old friend bacon, sizzling somewhere.

Having not had bacon since leaving home, I would have been happy if they'd served me a plate full of bacon, but there was eggs and fruit and sausages... it was like a real english breakfast and then some!

To make the day even better, when we got back to camp charled had make pancakes and bacon for brunch! could it be any more perfect!?!

KENYA POST
crossing into kenya, trouble getting the truck in. make lunch at the border. start playing cricket at the border, drew a crowd of truck drivers watching and trying to catch long shots.

3 options, leave the truck, pay a bond for the value of the truck (bond that you dont get back, luckly the truck is on the books as being worth $4k, instead of the 100K+ it would be worth) or pay a bribe

eventually we were able to pay a bribe of $300 to get the paperwork fudged.
