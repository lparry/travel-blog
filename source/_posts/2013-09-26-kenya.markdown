KENYA POST
crossing into kenya, trouble getting the truck in. make lunch at the border. start playing cricket at the border, drew a crowd of truck drivers watching and trying to catch long shots.

3 options, leave the truck, pay a bond for the value of the truck (bond that you dont get back, luckly the truck is on the books as being worth $4k, instead of the 100K+ it would be worth) or pay a bribe

eventually we were able to pay a bribe of $300 to get the paperwork fudged.


trouble getting the truck into kenya, carne? papers, changed rego, nmibenan
made lunch at the border, then people had a game of cricket, which drew a bit of a crowd of truck drivers watching and trying to catch long shots

3 options, leave the truck, pay a bribe, pay a "bond" for the value of the truck

paid bribe, charles negotiated because they were afraid dealing with steve, who's bot a white guy and can look pretty pissed off when he's not happy.

and so from teh very start we were exposed to corruption in kenya, and it wouldnt be the last bribe we needed to pay.

traffic coming into Nairobi was crazy, it took hours to go 20kms. it was so slow, with nowhere to stop, that someone on the truck peed in a bucket

stopped at a supermarket for supplied and dinner, coconut seafood pizza. first impression of the place is that it's like south africa. much more modern and developed.

The next morning back into safari 4wds. pretty disorganised, our driver didnt even know he was driving that day, had to stop to meet his wife to get clothes/stopped in nairobi for disel, but didnt actually fill up.

stopped again in a small town near the masai mara, every petrol station out of diseal.

waited 2 hours for one of the stations to get refueled. apparently one of the cars had been waiting 2 days.

the road into the masai mara was super bumpy and we drove along it at quite high speed. didn't help that our car was 30 years old and felt like the suspension was all original.

brakes failed, then the car wouldnt start. 

drove to the park gate, sorted out a replacement vehicle for the day.

drove straight in to where a leopard was walking around near some bushes. circus of cars, felt like we were getting way too close

after the leopard went into hiding we raced off and briefly saw a cheetah, then shot off again to see 2 lionesses & 6 cubs playing. got right up close again, engines off. up that close it was possible to forget the media circus that you were part of.

rangers arrive, everyone raced off. 10k shilling fine, or about $120

much lower penalties in kenya, compared to tanzania, where the drivers would loose their licence, which is why they're willing to break the rules and go way off road in the masai mara. I'm in two minds, on one hand it felt a bit more Zoo like, or that we were part of some horrible media paparatzi, but if you stayed back on the road you were only penalizing yourself because no-one else was and they'd all get in the way of you seeing anything at all. it was sort of special getting up so close to animals though.

static tents at the campsite, luxury!

Next morning, spotted lions from a long way away, having a go at a bird quite close to where they were the day before. 

big male lion sitting, 2 females eating, fighting a bit over food. 

females stare off, through us
wildebeast herd in the distance
one female and the male set off, down a gully and up the other side

chase a few different herds, split them up a bit but dont actually attack

we venture back and find 2 lionesses with cubs with 2 carcuses, both still kicking

one wildebeast got back up
lions saw somehow, ran it down but other vans obscured our view of the takedown

baby giraffe and mother

hippos in the river

4 cheetah on a rock, long way from road, no one else around, bring back other truck, chase warthog, turned on them

lion sleeping by the waterhole, spotted by leigh

last morning, up early

huge herd of elephants, 40 or so

2 lions eating with 2 cubs, herd of people and a crappy view

lots of driving looking for rhinos, didnt see mcuh

other truck saw a wild dog, very rare, steve (in our truck) very keen to see, offered to pay the fine himself if we go and find it. no luck

drive back to camp 30 minutes early, steve hugely pissed off, drivers telling conflicting lies

drive back to the tarmac felt even longer and bumpier, then back to nairobi long again

new leg, new people joined the group, others left. lost charles, got mash

dinner at carnivore. disappointing, game meat banned in kenya (a long time agao actually), only ostrich and croc, lamb, beef, chicken pork. most out there thigns were ox testicles and chicken liver.

morning at galaria for supplies, ATM shenanigans. every atm empty until 10 minutes before we were supposed to meet up. stayed there and maxed out my limit. extra time because the cab driver leighs phone was left in was coming to drop it off. managed to get it changed to USD and finally had enough to cover the kitty for the rest of the trip, such a relief

Drove to Lake Nakuru, heavy rain, campsite turned to mud and it was quite cold so we got an upgrade. truck bogged

early morning game drive around lake nakuru. lake flooding for a long time now. nowhere to drain. large forest near the waters edge so waterlogged that most of the trees had fallen over, all the flamingos were gone because the algae they eat is too deep here now

saw lots of black rhinos, a lion, and giraffes play fighting bashing necks, but the highlight was the epic bogging

first van went through and got stuck, got towed out. second van went the exact same way, got stuck

our van went the other way, engine redlining, managed to make it to the other side!

4wd came by eventually and towed other van out. then tried to cross through the middle but fell in deep hole, one wheel floating in the air!

crossed the equator into the northern hemisphere! uneventful. weather mostly the sae :P

crossed the border into uganda, no problems getting out of kenya or into Uganda.
