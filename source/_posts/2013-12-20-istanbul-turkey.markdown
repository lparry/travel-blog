After flying into Istanbul Attaturk airport we spent the morning hiding out at
the airport in the air conditioning and waiting for the time we'd agree to meet
at our apartment with our AirBNB host. We got a taxi from the airport and my
first impressions of Istanbul proper were that everything appeared so clean,
modern and organised. The highways were multi-lane, there was nobody wandering
out trying to sell things to passing traffic, traffic flowed very quickly and
efficiently, people drove on the correct side of the road and actually stayed in
their lanes for the most part. It's amazing how much your direct prior
experiences can colour your perceptions of a place, the Turkey we were seeing
was at odds to the reputation that the place generally has for it's drivers.

The apartment we stayed in was located very close to Taksim Square, consisting
of the whole top floor of the building and a rooftop courtyard and a fantastic
view of the Bosporus. Having modern conveniences like a fridge, a washing
machine and air conditioning felt very luxurious after having just spent 5 weeks
camping in tents.

As soon as we'd put our bags down we headed out in search of food and quickly
located our first kebaps of the trip. Very delicious and super cheap too. We
continued up to Taksim square and found that the top corner of the square
consisted of about 6-7 kebab shops all side by side, which we soon dubbed the
kebab district. We made pretty regular trips to the kebab district on a quest to
find out which one had the best kebabs but it was sort of inconclusive, they
were all delicious!

Sadly that first night I got the news of my grandmother's death. She was my last
remaining grandparent and it was going to be sad news to get whenever it came,
but being surrounded by friend was probably the best I could have hoped for
while being so far from home.

All of us headed over to the Egyptian bazaar the next morning to do some
exploring. The Egyptian bazaar is right next to the grand bazaar, but a bit
smaller and (apparently) a bit less tourist focused although looking back I'm
not remembering a lot of stuff there I could imagine the locals coming to buy.
Maybe the bulk tobbaco and spices, but not the 100s of hookahs or the Kilos of
turkish delight.

We all agreed the place felt fairly busy and bustling, but people seemed a lot
less forceful about getting your attention or dragging you into their shops than
we were used to so it felt quite a bit more relaxed than Africa. It's
interesting to read reviews of the bazaar on trip advisor where a lot of people
complain about how invasive the touts are and how they couldn't cope with it
all, and it really goes to show just how subjective all the reviews on there are
and how much each individuals past experiences factor in.

grand bazar, huge market. clicked that "constantinople" from Assasins creed is
actually what istanbul used to be known as. amazing to start to feel like I know
my way around the city a little bit based off the map design of a video game.
Impressive amount of detail in that game.

had a carpet seller with an interesting angle "show me where you're from on this
map", I walked off and he followed me around the corner and there was a shop
with a carpet map in the window that he asked me to show him again, and then
tried to get me to com einto his shop

they're generally very helpful at tourist attractions, building up some sense of
friendship before trying to get you to go and visit their carpet stall.

squishy burgers

went to cistern, huge underground chamber with rows and rows of columns
supporting the ground above us.

went into the blue mosque, very beautiful building, but the inside of it felt a
bit spoilt by the horrible low hanging panel of lights that really stopped the
space from feeling as large and open as it should have felt. Amanda was super
impressed to see that they let women pray, but only from inside a little caged
off part at the back. so progressive, nice one islam!

got a ticket for the hop on/off bus tour, very disappointing commentry for a
city so rich with history. large stretches where they just played awful,
electronic styled versions of turkish music. later we got the same bus and it
went on a different route, and a third time it went a different route again.
sometimes with no commentry, sometimes repeating the same "fragment" 2-3 times
in a row. but eventually we got a bus that drove us over the bridge to asia and
back.

went to the consulate to vote, spectacular views.

met leigh and nicci for last drinks and a strawberry hookah as it was their last
night before they were heading back home to Scotland

evening boat cruise on the bosphorous, beautiful to see the city at night,
passed the dentist convention that was in town, lit up building with a bunch of
colgate signs. passed under the bridges, got to see their light shows. Amanda
feeling pretty unwell, taxi home.

went out for a late night kebap on taksim square and it was crazy packed with
people, reminded me a little bit of champs elese on NYE, although no where near
as packed. late night currency changes seemed to get actually quite busy

move from our airbnb apartment to a hostel over in the old city, friendly staff,
nice room and a rooftop bar with an amazing view of the blue mosque.

archeology museum, exhibit on underwater shipwrecks, with the wood preserved by
being covered in silt, so completely wet they cant dry it without it warping.
need to dry the wood very gradually.


went into topaki palace, magnificent grounds, some nice cafes and restaurants.
lovely mix of colours and architechture

misunderstanding about the musuem card, only valid for a single entry at each
place , so I had to rush through the Harem (only accessible from inside the
palace) too.

interesting quarters for the sultan and his family and his concubines, but many
secetions (ie. concubine baths) were completely closed off for restoration
works.

weapons section with swords longer than I am tall


went through the ancient religious relics section, rather dull IMO but it was
interesting to see a guy sitting at a desk doing prayers live into a microphone
that was being piped around the exhibit. I'd assumed they were prerecorded

beard trim from a barber, first time I've paid a barber in probably a decade.
very thorough work, thinning sides and gave it a better shape. shaved head with
a straight razor, trimmed nose hairs, eye brows, ear hairs, then waved a lit
cotton tip around my ears to burn off hair and wax. much neater.

went to hagia sofia "museum", used to be a mosque, not really very much info.
much more open feeling, aside from the half of the space that was full of
scaffolding.

search for new bag, lots of top loading hiking bags, not much luck

got a kebab and arayan for 2 TL, $1. so damn cheap.

eventually found a deuter store with some proper travel packs, wened up going
completely against my original ideals and got a 70+10 pack. now I can fit
everythign, including the sleeping back and air mattress without a lot of
messing around packing things carefully. I'm sticking 

travel agent visit to plan how to best use the next few weeks in turkey

went out for dinner and had testi kebabs. comes out in a clay pot that they
smash the neck off to serve your meal. amazingly tender meat, so delicious.

traded off some of my left over duty free raki at the hostel bar for some free
beers! saved me trying to deal with the extra weight on super budget flights low
luggage allowance


up early the next day for our flight to Goreme, capadocia.
