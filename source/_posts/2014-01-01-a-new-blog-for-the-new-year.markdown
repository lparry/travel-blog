It's 2014 and you'll probably notice things look quite a bit different. I've
done what any good procrastinator would do when faced with little to no internet
and a lot of time to spare; I've completely revamped my blog so it's nicer to
work with when I dont have internet, and have a copy that works without relying
on the existance of tumblr. (Sorry Amanda, I bet you thought I was going to
actually have written a post about Turkey at last :P)

Anyhow, comments from the old site should migrate over in the next 24 hours. Let
me know if you notice anything that looks broken.
