Intro


Flew into manchester, then got the train to nottingham where I met matt at one
of the local brewpubs, The Vat and Fiddle, a castle rock pub. welcomed with a
few pints there, then another few at Brewdog

full english breakfast, then headed to nottingham castle for the robin hood beer
festival. 1100 casks of ale, 900 tapped at any one time, others "settling". 300
ciders. two tokens for a 1/3rd of a pint "taster", but you can get a sample of
any of the beers the volume of what you'd get for a token at an aussie beer
festival for free before you commit to any one beer to make sure you like it.

<!-- more -->

the people working serving the beers seemed pretty knowlegable and wanted to
make sure you got beers you were happy with. mostly unaffiliated with any
breweries, just beer lovers volunteering.

amazing variety of beers and food available. I at a zebra burger from a place
with all sorts of wild game meat (wild boar, kangaroo, etc), more variety than
at *that place in kenya*. england's repuation for boring food is well out of
date these days. 

Amanda and Luke met up with us at the festival not long after lunch, great to
see them again.

I worked it out and I think I only drank about 6 pints over the whole day there,
but I got to try dozens of different ales. My favourite beer was bateman's
hazelnut brownie, a very rich syrupy beer, delicious aroma; the name is pretty
much spot on. Not exactly a session beer, but delicious.

stopped in at 'ye old trip to jerusalem", one of the claims to "the oldest pub in the UK", serving beer since 1189AD. it's partly carved out of a sandstone cave, very cool to think that people have been drinking there for nearly 1000 years.

last stop for the night was at the canalhouse, a little pub on the canals that
actually has a section of the shipping canals that actually runs inside the pub,
presumably for unloading casks of ale back in the days (any maybe still today?).
There we had a few very "big" craft beers, which probably didn't help with the way we woke up feeling the next morning. In case you cant guess, it wasnt fantastic.

Once we were up and going the next day, we made a visit to the op shops in the
rich part of town, where I managed to score a fine winter jacket for 8 pounds
and a dapper hat for 6.50. Not travelling with winter clothes worked out pretty
much perfectly for me this time; and hopefully will again if I end up somewhere
cold again in the future.

We did some scenic driving and had a nice long lunch at the unicorn hotel, a
very traditional style countryside pub, where the pedigree ale pie was fantastic.


On saturday we went back to the beer festival for it's biggest day. We didn't
have pre-bought tickets so we got there before the gates opened to try and
ensure we'd get in, only to find a line of people winding way down the hill and
around the corner, all the while with england giving us some of it's typically
wonderful weather. ie. it pissed down rain.

Once the gates opened the line actually moved quite quickly (although it
continued to grow about as fast as it moved), but we all got in without much
hassle.

we went straight to the table area and secured outselves a table and then I got
some chicken tikka masala for breakfast. No drinking without a bit of "balast"
as Matty P liked to put it.

This day we focused mostly on the top tent where our table was, which conviently
had the most different beers available. there was a bottom tent, and then a few
other "renegade" tents with only one or two breweries beers available in them
two, that I neglected to mention in my earlier descriptions.

Luke and Amanda headed off to explore the south of England, but I'd decided I
want to stop moving for a while and stayed put in nottingham for quite a long time.

Life for me mostly consisted of sleeping in, reading/practicing spanish or
spinning poi, then when Matty got home from his epicly long days at work we'd go
out and visit any one of the many local pubs, trying as many different ales as
humanly possible.

It felt like a mutually benificial situation, Matty got a drinking buddy, and I
got days to just chill and do nothing without feeling like I was wasting my
limited time in city X for a while. 


After a few weeks of this it was time to head to london for Amanda and Luke's
leaving Europe celebrations. Matty and I got the bus in to Victoria Station,
then headed straight to Camden to have a Lunch at a nice pub Matt knew, where
thye served soemthing called a "Cheese and bacon dirty burger". how can you go
wrong with a name like that?

We then headed to a pub called the old haberdashery, where we were meeting
Amanda &  Luke, Leigh and Nikki, and a few other random people we know who
happen to be in london and had the afternoon free.

After a lot of beers and reminicing, we headed to the boom festival teaser
party, the main event for the evening, which sadly was a poorly organised
disaster. We spent two hours waiting in line to get in (that was all with
pre-booked tickets, the event was sold out), a cloak room line that didn't move
in the 15 minutes I stood there before decided I wouldnt bother (I'd guess
another 2 hours to cloak a jacket, and another 3 to get it back at the end of
the night), A stupid token system at the bar which mean you had to queue up
twice when you wanted a drink, or buy loads of tokens and risk having a bunch of
unused tokens at the end of the night, and just plain way too many people packed
into a tiny venue making the place stupidly hot that we went outside to the
smoking area just to get out of the heat, and I was so hot that I was happy
outside in London at the end of Autumn in just a T-shirt for a good half hour
before I stopped feeling overheated.

I'd love to say even in the face of all that I had a good time, but I didn't.
pretty much everything about the night sucked, and I was getting so mad about
how terribly planned everything was that I got a yelling at from Nicki about how
negative I was being. I completely understand not wanting to make a bad
situation feel worse, but when everything was done and dusted the next week I
don't think anyone had a positive word to say about the event. I don't know how
boom Festival could let such a shambles tarnish their brand like that.

We left before the event finished, as soon as the trains to cambridge were running again, and like sleepless zombies endured something like 3 changes back and forth onto buses because of weekend track works. Thank you amanda for staying awake and making sure we got there in the end!

In cambridge we were staying at Amanda's good friend Andrew's place, where we
walked in, he handed us bacon sandwiches and then we all lay down and got some
well needed rest. Andrew was heading off to visit his family, so we sort of
house sitted for him for Amanda and Luke's last few days in Europe. Cards
against humanity (The UK version) was played, 65 pounds of fireworks were
purchased and set off in a near by field (45 seconds of non-stop explosions),
cheese and wines were drank and good times were had.

After our few days there, Matty drove Luke and Amanda to london in their own
car that he is tasked with fixing up and selling next summer. by the time we got
there, it was peak hour, so we stopped at a suburb in the outskirts and had a
few drinks until the trains would have quitened down, then said our goodbyes to
our good friends and wished them well on their American travels; before making
the long drive back to nottingham.


Matt kindly sorted us out some transport so we could go and check out the one
real thing on my list of stuff to see in England, Stonehenge. I think the desire
to see it actually comes from the movie European Vacation, which is kind of
lame, but the real deal is pretty cool.

On the drive there we were buffeted with ice cold winds, dark clouds and rain,
but the wind actually worked in out favour, blowing us a clear patch in the sky
while we were waiting in line to get in, that lasted for our whole visit. The
weather while we were there was stunning, probably some of the best I saw during
this visit.

Learnt some interesting stuff from the far too verbose audioguides (when the
number plaques are only 10M of grass lawn apart, yet the audio companion
blabbers on for 20 minutes, you might be going into too much detail for the
average visitor). 1/3rd of each pillar is actually underground, meaning that the
already quite huge stones are actually 50% huger than they appear; they have
*pegs and holes* helping keep the tops in place on the pillars; and the
heaviest one is estimated to weight 45 Tons. Another amazing construction
project that nobody truely knows how they accomplished it, although they have
some theories that sound pretty reasonable.

After Stonehenge we headed to Bristol to visit an old friend, Jen, and to check
out some of the Banksy pieces around the city. I got an iphone app guide to his
work around the city, which sadly a large proportion of have been vandalised and
since painted over, but it was awesome to see the ones that were still there.

We caught up with Jen over a few drinks, then headed to a fancy little
microbrewery bar and had way to many more tasty beers, followed by an obligitory
going-to-bed kebab before sleeping in the van. I slept in the back (whcih I
found out was not exactly sealed from the outside air) and matt slept in the
cabin. I was glad to have a reasonable sleeping bag that night.

The next day Matt and I both felt rubbish, so we wandered around trying to find
osmewhere that was open to get a decent breakfast, eventually finding a place
called the bristolian that had a great english breakfast, helping us both
feel much much better.

We decided to go and visit bath that day, a picutrequse city full of beautiful
architechure. We walked around the city a bit, saw a stealthy bridge (shops
built on both sides of it hide the fact there's a bridge there at all), before
making the very long drive back to nottingham.



I spent a few of my last few days of this visit to England in London, revisiting
sites I'd been to a decade earlier when I lived an hour away in Ipswich; lots of
nice nolstagia.

I went to buckingham palace and the huge gardens nearyby, walked over to big ben
and westminster abbey, then walked along the Thames for a bit before it started
raining.

I headed over to Trafalga square and leicster square and bought some last minute
ticekts to see "The book of mormon", a musical by the southpark guys, for that
evening.

I tracked down a very fancy london beard barber shop and got my beard shaped for
way to much money, but you only live once. I got some good tips about shaping it
myself (that I screwed up a few months later) and some tips on handlebar
moustaches.

I visited the london transport museum
which was quite an interesting collection about all the eras and advancements in
public transport in London. Funny to see signs from the start of last century
for the same stuff that people need to be told today (don't block the doors,
move down the isle, let people off first). It seems like common sense may never
have actually been common. I'd actually hoped the museum would have a bit more
of a focus on the underground specifically than it did, nearly completely
missing information about the many abandoned underground stations, or 3d models
of how the whole network and it's supporting escalators/lifts actually fit
together.

I went along to the Book of Mormon, which by that point was sold out completely,
but my seat was actually pretty decent on the ground floor with a good view of
the stage. one of the advantages of breaking social norms and doing things
alone. The musical was a funny tale of two mormons who get sent to uganda to
preach, one of who is a compulsive liar, the other a "star" mormon. The star
loses faith so the liar steps up and makes up even crazier stuff than actual
mormonizism to get the ugandans to stop doing bad things, such as killing one
another or raping babies to cure their aids. I thought it poked a lot of fun of
mormons, while not actually crossing any lines as far as southpark normally
does.

The next morning I went and saw london bridge, which is pretty dull but had a
great view of the tower bridge, which I love to look at.

I looped around and visted the tower of london, did the tour led by a beefeater
which I enjoyed just as much as last time. They have great delivery of their
stories and jokes making it both informative and enjoyable.

I went thorugh and saw the crown jewels, this time looking out in particular for
the big ones stolen from africa and india that I'd learned about in my travels,
which they don't make very much note about that side of the story and that they
wont return them.

new interesting fact I learnt was that the tower was actually used as a menagery
at one stage, filled with all kinds of exotic animals. a lot of the animal
keeping back then left a lot to be desired, for example they had ostriches but
didn't knowwhat they ate, so they tried feeding them iron nails, which of course
killed them; and they used to have a polar bear on a leash that could swim in
the thames.

I went past the monument to the great fire of london, a very impressive pillar
mostly hidden by the large buildings around it, then got the tube to camden
where I was staying for the night. 

Camden has some very cool culture and attracts some very odd people. One example
was a tallented girl who was busking near the train station on an electric
violin, while some douchebag sat metres in front of her listening to his
ipod, moving only when someone tapped him on the shoulder and pointed out what
an incredibly rude twat he was being.

I wandered around the markets, seeing loads fo great street art, vintage and
victorian clothes, and lots of other cool stuff to look at. I wish I had
unlimited cash and no weight restrictions so I could buy a whole new wardrobe,
try out a completely new style (or just _have_ a style really).

I visited cyberdog, which is pretty much mandatory when going to camden, a store
that pretty much doubles as a night club. The lights are dimmed, the UVs are on,
there's a live hard trance DJ spinning records and everything. The place is full
of rave clothes and cool trinkets, a tetris night light that comes appart
completely and the blocks light up as you stack them in whatever order you
please, pacman ghost ponchos. Quite an unique and wonderful shop.

I spent the evening checking out my hostels open mic night, where the acts
varied from extremely tallented, to please-stop-now, this is painful.

The next morning mostly got wasted at the apple store. the camera in my phone
had been showing some weird artifacts, which meant they were happy to replace it
on the spot. unfortunately this mean I had a blank phone and needed to restore
from icloud in order to have access to any of my important stuff like maps and
my bus ticket back to nottingham, and the wifi in an apple store gets hammered
pretty heavily by all the people using it so it took forever and then some.
Still, shiny brand new phone for the 3rd time! I feels there's definitely been a
drop in build quality from the iPhone 4 production to the iPhone 5. Gonna extend
the apple care on this handset to make sure it still works for at least one more
year, if not hopefully more.

The afternoon was entirely spent at the science museum, full of fascinating
exhibatios of aviation, mechanical computers, the materials things are made of,
the human body and loads more. I spent 5 hours there before they kicked everyone
out and closed, but I wish I had more time as there was so many more sections to
visit.

I met up with my old friend Andrew, who lived in Australia for a year a while
back, and we went to a nice pub called "The cask" for some delicious ales and
some very gourmet burgers, and a lot of catching up. We talked "shop" for a
while and it was reassuring to still be able to feel like I'm not too far out of
the loop. I guess tech change quickly, but the ranting points change much more
slowly.

 got the bus home, which didn't make it into nottingham until 2am, stumbled back
to matty's place and passed out.

The next morning matty made us an epic breakfast for lunch, then we set out to
make one last visit to all the pubs in the area before I left. In at brewdog we
had a nip of Tactical Nuclear Penguin each, one of their rare, strong (40%?),
exotic and expensive drops, that thankfully at the bar at least they'll sell by
the 30ml (instead of having to buy a 375ml bottle) it was supurb, but it's an
impossible beer to follow as the flavour is just so intense.

On my final day in England, we drove out to a nice country pub which a pretty
sad selection of ales, so then drove back into town where we found a place doing
an awesome sunday roast for lunch, conviently located near the build used as
Wayne manor in Batman, which we also checked out. It's a very impressive mansion
with a huge green grounds surrounding it.

The next day I was off early to catch a flight to Berlin, Germany, to find out
just how large the gaps in my knowledge about the cold war really were (huge!)
