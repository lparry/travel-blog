Once I'd gotten into Berlin and checked into my hostel I got in contact with my
friend Erin, an American who I met in South Africa who lives in Berlin on a
semi-regular basis. We arranged to meet up for dinner and she offered to give me
an introductory tour of the city. It was pretty lucky timing as Erin was leaving
Berlin for a month just a few days after I arrived.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575837835/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Alexanderplatz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/13575837835_b631a6aafb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alexanderplatz S-Bahn Station"></a>

We  walked all around the city, past the museum island, Potsdamer Platz,
Brandenburger Tor, The Jewish Memorial, and loads of other sites around the
city. It was quite the whirlwind introduction to the city, we even visited a
small Christmas market and had some gluhwein! Delicious spiced wine served hot,
perfect for the cold nights leading up to Christmas. It was lovely to see Erin
again and it felt like a nice way to get to know the city being shown around by
someone who obviously loves the place.

<!-- more -->

I feel a bit bad about having zero photos with Erin or the places we went to go
with this part of the post, but at times while travelling I've been hit by
"photo sorting fatigue", which leaves me in a state where I think to myself "if
I don't take any photos I wont have to sort them!", which leads to gaps like
we have here.

We met up again the next day to go and visit Tempelhof Park, an old airfield
that has been turned into a public park, but still has all the runways and stuff
there. It's kind of surreal to be wandering around one what quite obviously was
a fairly big airfield, with people jogging past or cycling on bikes.  These days
there's a community garden there and areas dedicated for having BBQs and stuff.
It seems like it would be a lovely place to spent time at in the summertime, and
would make a great venue for a music festival.

We went out that night for pizza with Erin's housemates, Nicole and Nicole, as a
chance to meet each other and see how we got along, and to see about the
possibility of me taking Erin's room while she was away. The two Nicoles were
both lovely and it seemed like it would be cool to live in a typical German
apartment for at least some of my stay in Berlin. They were happy to have me
take the room, so I got to move in a few days after Erin left.

In my last few days staying in the hostel I met a Dutch guy named Harmen who was
a bit of a history buff and seemed like a nice fellow, so we decided to explore
some of the city together. We went to the Holocaust Museum, which was very
interesting but there was just too much information there to process it all, so
by 3/4 of the way through I was skipping reading 90% of the text and was pretty
well museum-fatigued.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525055773/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/13525055773_8cd2455173_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe"></a>

To combat that we went into a nearby bar for a rest and a few beers. We got talking
with the bartender, a girl from Birmingham named Carley, who gave us some good
tips for some neighbourhoods to go exploring later in the evening.

After we felt able to tackle another museum we headed to the Topography of
Terror museum, a museum built right next to the foundations of the headquarters
of the Secret State Police, the SS and the Reich Security Main Office of the
Third Reich.  Its also coincidentally right next to a long segment of the Berlin
wall that was still in place, complete with some large holes smashed in the
concrete.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525750244/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3785/13525750244_66e9ee1851_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall"></a>

It was great having Harmen there to fill in the massive gaps in my knowledge
about German history. I know we covered the World Wars in high school, but I
don't think we ever even touched on the cold war (I guess because Australia
played no part in it, and our history classes seemed to have been very biased
towards things that Australia took part in, rather than important events that
shaped the world as it is today.

I never really enjoyed history at school, but I now think that was largely
because of the incredibly narrow focus that my small rural high school had in
its classes.  The stuff I've learned about while travelling about the history in
a bunch of other countries has been fascinating. Far more interesting than
hearing about Australia being slaughtered at Gallipoli for the hundredth time.

The Topography of Terror museum was another really good museum, covering the
various groups involved in carrying out the atrocities of WWII. It focused a lot
more on the "who" and what they did; some very interesting perspectives there,
but again too much information to take it all in in only one visit.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525606303/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Spaceman by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/13525606303_19c05ecd34_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Spaceman near Kottbusser"></a>

Harmen and I then went to Kottbusser Tor, the suburb recommended to us by Carley
earlier in the day, and found that although it seemed like an interesting suburb
with a lot of cool street art, there seemed to be nothing but Turkish
Restaurants around. If you've read my post about Turkey, you'll know I adore
Turkish food, but being newly in Germany we were really wanting to eat some
German food and it honestly felt a bit disheartening that a single culture had
so completely squeezed out all others in the food scene in this part of the
city. I'm would think there's a saturation point for number of kebab shops you
really need on any one street, and I'm pretty sure the streets of Kottbusser tor
crossed that point long ago.

We ended up caving in and getting Turkish food since there seemed like there was
no other option, and it was quite frankly disappointing. Overpriced and dry,
leaving me even more confused how such an average restaurant can survive in the
face of so much competition?

After dinner we went to a tapas bar for a while to soak in the bohemian/hipster
vibe they had going on there, before heading over the bridge near Warschauer
Straße station into a district of old warehouses that had been converted into
bars, skate parks, climbing centres and all kinds stuff, all decorated outside
with loads and loads of awesome graffiti.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13562682523/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Mural by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/13562682523_baf9b0ce7d_c.jpg" width="800" height="396" alt="Mural"></a>

We found a nice little bar in what seemed to be a bit of a multi-purpose
building. At various times I saw through different doors and I'm sure I saw 2-3
different bars, a room that looked to be some sort of music recording studio,
and what I think might have been a juggling studio up stairs. Quite an eclectic
mix.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525867974/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hipster folk music by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/13525867974_09174cf869_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hipster folk music"></a>

They had some live music happening in the bar, initially a single guy
alternating between playing a pan flute and a ukulele, then more musicians
arrived with other strange instruments. One woman had a mouth harp, another guy
had something that looked like the love-child of a sitar and an accordion with a
little crank at one end, and the original guy switched over to playing something
that appeared to be a bag pipe, but with inoffensive tuning. For serious, a bag
pipe without the piercing pitch. They two of them started doing some folk
dancing. It was quite the cool little show. Brunswick hipsters, eat your heart
out.

Another day I went an walked along Karl-Marx Allee, a huge boulevard built by
the GDR/DDR, I guess to show off how great communism is. It is lined with lots
of massive buildings built during the early years of the Cold War.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13526156075/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Big East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13526156075_e9e5c61fe9_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Big East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee"></a>

There are some interesting communist "ads" on top of a few buildings,
interesting because being communist meant there wasn't really a need for any
advertising since there was no competition between companies, but there were ads
for stuff in West Berlin and didn't want to be outdone by them.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525982215/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Communist era advertising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/13525982215_8b0917a31b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Communist era advertising"></a>

There was also a small model of Sputnik on top of a cafe.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13526227694/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Cafe with Sputnik on top of it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3701/13526227694_48e9c1fe96_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cafe with Sputnik on top of it"></a>

But the highlight for me, completely unrelated to it's socialist past, was the
epic video game museum. It contained pretty much every console imaginable and
loads of classic games, and some classic arcade machines too. The place brought
out a huge amount of nostalgia in me, so many great memories.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13538254253/in/set-72157643245435323" title="So much video game history by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3771/13538254253_f0fd2c472a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So much video game history"></a>

Some pieces of note included the original Sega Master System, my first
every console,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13527934633/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sega Master System by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/13527934633_574d3fd060_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Sega Master System. NFI why it says Mark III, this was the one before the SMSII in Australia"></a>

A virtual reality machine I have memories of paying way too much to have a turn
of at a video game arcade somewhere in Queensland when I was a kid,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13528085255/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3756/13528085255_3da8f04e72_c.jpg" width="645" height="800" alt="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid"></a>

An Apple II, signed by the brains behind it, Steve Wozniak,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13528026095/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Apple II, signed by Woz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7090/13528026095_1e823e32aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="605" alt="Apple II, signed by Woz"></a>

And this very unique arcade machine called the PainStation, which was a multi
player game that burnt, electrocuted and whipped the players while they played a
game, whoever flinched away first lost.
[Seriously](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13536673074/in/set-72157643245435323).
It wasn't switched on so I can't say how bad the pain really was.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13536495093/in/set-72157643245435323" title="PainStation by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/13536495093_06657420b0_c.jpg" width="598" height="800" alt="PainStation"></a>

I did a huge amount of exploration around Berlin appreciating the street art,
probably at least 4-5 days whole days worth in total if you added it all up. I
did a few "self guided" walking tours (as in I had an itinerary or stuff to look
for found somewhere online), A ton of randomly wandering after spotting a cool
piece by chance, and a "Real Berlin" free walking tour that seemed to be quite
heavily street art focused.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567379395/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Rainbow drips by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/13567379395_6fc9b174a3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rainbow drips"></a>

On one of my many aimless explorations I stumbled upon some buskers playing in
the street who were drawing quite a crowd.  A band called [The Trouble
Notes](http://www.thetroublenotes.com/). One guy planing an electric violin, one
guy finger picking the heck out of a guitar while also using it as a percussion
instrument, and another dude sitting on a unique drum that was just kind of a
square box. They had a very beautiful sound and were so damn good I stopped and
listened to them for probably an hour.  I even bought a CD to support them, even
though I have nothing to play it in! And I got a flyer for a show later in the
month in a very hidden away warehouse.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13553720455/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The Trouble Notes are awesome! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/13553720455_f90767f22c_c.jpg" width="679" height="800" alt="The Trouble Notes are awesome!"></a>

I moved in with the Nicoles on the day of a "crafternoon" that was still in
progress when I arrived. I hung out and tried to make an origami animal that had
been stumping everyone all afternoon (damned if I can remember what the animal
was now), but we struggled with it for a very long time before finding out there
were instruction in the front explaining all the different arrows.  With this
Nicole A was able to successfully make the animal! (I thought only men didn't
read instructions, but now I know better :P)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13562823055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Fancy car and a colourful wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5457/13562823055_133c3262f8_c.jpg" width="800" height="357" alt="Fancy car and a colourful wall"></a>

I spent an entire day exploring the street art around Warschauer Straße
Station, in and amongst the converted warehouse along Revaler Straße. The area
oozes creativity, with nearly every surface being covered in a colourful mural
and most of the people looked like the sorts of folk my dad would look at
disapprovingly as dirty hippies, my kind of people :)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564232873/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Berlin by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/13564232873_e9b584efaf_c.jpg" width="800" height="447" alt="Berlin"></a>

I walked along the nearby East Side Gallery, a 1.3km long section of the wall
that is not used as an open air art gallery. There over 100 painting, all of
them huge. There was also a whole row of Trabants, the car of East Germany,
parked along the side the wall.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13563950605/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Trabants by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/13563950605_04431b441e_c.jpg" width="800" height="752" alt="Trabants"></a>

I walked the whole length of the wall and then some of the backside as well and
was lucky enough to come upon a bunch of artists spending their Sunday afternoon
painting the backside of the wall and having a few beers. Work in progress

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564854475/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sunday drinks while painting the wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/13564854475_694238308f_c.jpg" width="800" height="290" alt="Sunday drinks while painting the wall"></a>

Another day I went on a "Real Berlin Walking Tour", as recommended by a friend
who lived in Berlin briefly. The tour had a strong focus on graffiti and street
art, which I didn't know about beforehand and meant we went to several places
I'd already checked out. It was great a knowledgeable guide there to point
specific artists works and styles, and then start recognising their stuff all
around the city.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565480803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Garbage Elephant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/13565480803_2d4637d7f0_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street"></a>

I think our guide must have been well connected in with the street art community
based on how much he seemed to know about individual artists, techniques, etc. I
almost suspect he may have been one of the artists, although he denied it when I
asked.

On the tour I learned some more about the Berlin wall and the Cold War. One
interesting titbit I picked up was that West Berlin was the only part of West
Germany that didn't have conscription, which led to many of the liberals
migrating there, which could explain the very liberal culture that exists there
today.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565231714/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/13565231714_49c68617c3_c.jpg" width="800" height="391" alt="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river"></a>

I also learned how property developers have been allowed to start developing
along the lovely green strip behind the long strip of wall that makes up the
East Side Gallery, what a fuck up! I thought the one building that was in
progress when I walked along there was a horribly inconvenient eye sore, meaning
you could no longer walk along the full length of both sides of the wall. To
find out they're now planning on building along most of that strip, including a
section currently occupied by an African Youth support centre who are being
evicted, is terrible.  Wikipedia even tells me they're going to knock down
extensive segments of the gallery.

Another day I visited the Deutsches Technikmuseum, the German Museum of
Technology. I love science and technology museums as a rule, although this one
had such a heavy focus on trains and planes that you could be forgiven for
thinking it was a transport museum.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568945104/in/set-72157643245435323" title="This musuem had a crazy number of planes in it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/13568945104_6685df757b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically"></a>

I especially liked this jet engine that was opened up so I could poke my head
inside and get an idea of the insides of one of those things and how the
"reverse thrust" thing planes do to stop actually works. I've since tried to
look out the window as a flight was landing to try and see this in action but
the wing gets in the way. :(

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568499815/in/set-72157643245435323" title='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/13568499815_3175e0b7e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position'></a>

Admittedly there were some other smaller sections about old bicycles, medicine,
photography, old mechanical computers and televisions.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567596055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wooden bike by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7077/13567596055_f5671ee900_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wooden bike, totally hipster"></a>

Some of the old televisions had Cathode Ray tubes so long that they would
orient them with the screen facing the ceiling, and then use a 45º mirror to
flip the image so a sitting viewer could watch it. To think today there are
2+ metre televisions that are only a few cm thick... The progress of technology
is awesome!

One evening while I was still staying with the two Nicoles, I went and saw The
Trouble Notes do a live show with them and a friend of theirs. The venue was an
old building hidden down a very dark alley, surrounded by building that felt
like they were largely abandoned. It felt like the kind of place you went down
to get stabbed, but it turned out ok for us. The Trouble Notes put on very good
show, even if the support act was a bit too emo and the venue was super smoky.
It really feels like I got in a time machine and went back 20 years to be back
in a place where you can smoke in public venues.


I spent a few days exploring the various museums on the Museum Island. First up
was the Pergamon museum, which has in it's collection a giant Babylonian gate,
and an ancient temple plundered from turkey.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570513833/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Pergamon Altar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/13570513833_b093193675_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pergamon Altar"></a>

I read up and learnt that the Babylonian gate on display is actually the
smaller, rear-side of the entrance way. The front must have been absolutely
epic!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570336943/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Ishtar Gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7338/13570336943_508a1c623f_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ishtar Gate"></a>

The New Musuem was great, I found the building itself to be very interesting,
with each room styled differently and quite uniquely. Much of it has been
reconstructed since the war. It's funny, the place felt too old to be calling it
the new museum.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570806863/in/set-72157643245435323" title="More plundered loot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/13570806863_91ff2f0594_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="More plundered loot in the New Museum"></a>

I also went to the Old Museum which looks majestic from the outside, but I felt
the inside of the building lacked any real character and was rather dull and
sterile.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570964433/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The old museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/13570964433_e1959ec409_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The old museum"></a>

One morning I booked in to visit the Reichstag Building (the German Parliament),
a building with an impressive glass dome on top of it, which you can go up for a
nice view. It's free but you have to book online in advance.

Surprise track work meant that I was pretty late, I'd left home cutting things
pretty fine according to Google maps estimations, but then there were no trains
running on the line I needed to change to, so I had to go to another station on
a different line, then practically run to try and get there near the time I was
scheduled to, all the while being mobbed by supposedly deaf street collectors.

They hand you a card with a little statement in a bunch of languages asking you
to sign their clipboard (petition? I cant remember), then if you don't read that
clipboard you suddenly find you've signed up to make a donation.  Call me a
cynic, but those deaf collectors look just like the gypsies in every other city
in Europe.  I suspect they've just come up with a new way of extracting money
from people without having to speak any language in particular.

It was a very impressive building, the inside of the dome containing a structure
of mirrors to collect and reflect light down into the parliament, lessening the
need for artificial lighting.

There was a ramp spiralling up around the dome, with an audio guide that is
automatically activated as you walk around, giving you a great (but hard to
photograph) view of the city in all directions.

I had hesitations about visiting the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, because the
street outside makes the whole area feel like an awful tourist trap, but it
turned out to be nothing of the sort and was way better than I expected.

It contained lots of interesting stories about the many successful and
unsuccessful attempts to escape from East Germany to flee to the west.  There
were stories about escapes hidden in the modified engine bay cars, secret
compartments in huge welding machines, one woman who hid in a pair of suitcases
side by side on the luggage rack of a train, hot air balloons, gliders, even
some submarine attempts in the Baltic sea. The museum was actually very large,
but I think the layout means a lot of people miss half of it. I pretty much had
the place to myself in that section.

One very cold a miserable day I went out to see Sachsenhausen concentration
camp, out at Oranienburg. The camp was about a two kilometre walk from the
station in literally freezing cold mist.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574136123/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sachsenhausen concentration camp by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5154/13574136123_5128f1e198_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Sachsenhausen concentration camp"></a>

This camp had also been used by the Russians around 1945-50 after the war ended,
although the use of the camp continued to be used to kill those who opposed the
government after the war. There was lots of info about individual prisoners
accounts and that sort of thing, but it was all fragments so I left without a
very good picture of what things were like during that later period.

The foundations of the buildings containing the gas chambers and the oven were
all that is left. This building also contained the neck-shot room, in which they
would tell the prisoners they were going to measure their height against a tape
measure on the wall, but then a person in the adjoining room would fire a shot
through a slit in the wall straight into their neck, killing them. The Nazis
were not nice people at all.

The exhibition in the infirmary had mention of there being a brothel on site,
where females prisoners were forced to work, being raped by soldiers and
selected prisoners as a means of rewarding them. Really messed up stuff.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574950624/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Guard tower by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/13574950624_3b90ef9ba6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Guard tower"></a>

It was cold enough that most water on the ground had frozen solid, and the misty
rain that started again as the sun was setting was awfully cold, but strangely
appropriate for the venue. It really sunk in how hard it would have been being a
new prisoner arriving in the winter, being given only summer clothes and made to
stand out in the yard for 24 hours, not being allowed to move. I'm not surprised
by how many died on their first night there.

After leaving the camp I walked past a gluhwein seller not far down the road
who was an absolute lifesaver. There's nothing like a hot, alcoholic beverage to
warm your chilled bones.

It was about this time that I had to move out from the Nicoles place as they had a friend coming to stay for Thanksgiving. I was sad to be
leaving, they're both really lovely people. They made me feel right at home
while I was there with them, so welcoming and friendly.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576145783/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2835/13576145783_14b4d46382_c.jpg" width="765" height="800" alt="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort"></a>

Random fact about Nicole and Nicole is they like tea, and own enough of it to build a
tea-fort.

I moved to a hostel which had great reviews online, but turned out was almost
solely inhabited by very blokey Australian guys, aside from the one staff member
there who was English I think and very camp. I felt pretty out of place to put
it nicely.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574866713/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5278/13574866713_2ab2331733_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum"></a>

I went and had a look at an erotic museum, part of the oldest sex shop in the
world: Beate Uhse. It seemed like there was a lot of potential to have a very
interesting museum but I found the place sort of dull. One of the two floors was
almost solely about the woman who owned it, and the other floor was full of
drawings and things that you could have told me were kitsch holiday souvenirs
and I wouldn't have blinked.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576132425/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/13576132425_d19510e3d9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people"></a>

Having only just left the Nicoles place, I was invited back the next night to
take part in their Thanksgivukah celebrations, combining Thanksgiving and
Hanukkah. The food  was delicious, mostly vegetarian or vegan, and the deserts
were sickeningly sweet!  It was nice to meet some of their friends, one of whom
was an Australian girl who was also born in Wagga Wagga (the funnily named town
I was born in), and also moved away at a very young age. What are the odds?


I got an email from Harmen that he was back in Berlin again so we met up and
visited the DDR museum, a museum about how things were in East Germany during
the communist era. It was a great exhibition, but it's crying out for a bigger
space. The exhibition is overflowing with stuff to show so much so that half of
it is hidden behind little flaps or in draws that you pull out, which isn't
really compatible with having the place so packed full of people that there's no
room to open the exhibitions. Hopefully the popularity will lead to them
thinking about a bigger venue.

One really neat thing there was the recreation of the inside of an East
German apartment, complete with hidden bugs that you could listen to from
another room in the museum.

After the museum we went to to a brew pub called Brew Baker, that I'd been told
had an amazing pumpkin ale on a special brew, a style that I'd never tried
before. The pumpkin ale was alright, but the IPA and a super sweet dark beer
they also had were my favourites. It was located inside a really nice looking
little indoor market.

It was around this time I went and spent a day exploring Spreepark, an old
abandoned theme park that in a pretty derelict state that I [blogged about
earlier here](http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2013/12/05/spreepark-Berlin). Just
recently I saw [this
article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/berlin-just-bought-abandoned-theme-park-180950287/)
saying that the city of Berlin has now bought the park, so I may have gotten
very lucky getting to see it before it gets redeveloped into something else.

One morning I tried to go and see Schloss Charlottenburg, a huge palace now used
as a museum, but I didn't think about the fact it was Monday so the building was
closed. I got to explore the gardens though, which were really pretty.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575266765/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/13575266765_a2c54864c0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace gardens"></a>

There was a lovely light frosting on the parts of the very neatly manicured
garden that were in the shade which gave a lovely effect.

I spent my last few evenings in Berlin venturing around to various Christmas
markets. At home I've felt jaded about Christmas for many years, but there was
something about Christmas in Berlin that got through to.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575685933/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Christmas Markets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7378/13575685933_404c26c7ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets"></a>

For once it didn't feel like a giant event organised by big companies to sell
more shit. There was great food, tasty beverages, rides and amusements and most
importantly there were people having a good time. Contrast that to my image of
Christmas back home: overcrowded shopping malls full of people who don't want to
be there, and it's easy to see why I prefer the way Berlin does it.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576063984/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Gluhwein! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/13576063984_d6d4128944_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Gluhwein!"></a>

The first markets I went to was the huge one they have near Alexanderplatz,
which was kind of like a big show in a country town.  There were loads of places
selling gluhwein; you could get the regular stuff, optionally with a shot of
spirits or schnapps, or eierpunsch, which is yellow and creamy like eggnog,
super sweet and with whipped cream on top. They even had gluhbier, spiced beer
served warm that was rich and a little sweet.

I had some tasty shredded pork stuff for dinner, and a bag of "donut hole" type
things for desert, and boy did I feel sick afterwards from eating all that sweet
stuff.

I spent my last day  at the Berlin Wall memorial. There are fragments of the
multiple layers of wall, and there is an street that the wall still crosses
which is the last street still cut off by the wall today.

There's also a section that has been rebuilt that had both complete walls, a
guard tower and lights, giving you a much better feeling how it would be felt to
be trapped in East Germany during the Soviet era.

There's also a viewing tower built so you can get a more elevated view of the
whole thing.

There were some interesting stories about buildings that were right along the
border, that had doors opening both into East and West Berlin, allowing the
owners access to both sides. Eventually the West German side was bricked up to
stop people escaping via these houses, then the people were evicted, and finally
the buildings were torn down.

West Berlin also had the underground train network, parts of which passed
through under East Berlin city centre, but to stop people escaping through the
metro tunnels the stations in East Berlin were bricked up and abandoned.
Bernauer Straße station was one such station, but you wouldn't know it today.

My last night in Berlin I hit a few more of the more traditional style Christmas
markets at PrenzlauerBerg and Charlottenburg. These ones were far less fun-park
like and had even more variety in food and handicrafts. PrenzlauerBerg had a
strong showing of Swedish and Finnish stalls with their own takes on Gluhwein.
There was also some huge BBQs where the grill was suspended by chains above the
coals, slowly swinging and turning. I'm not sure if it had a functional purpose
but it looked cool!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576305803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/13576305803_c78197835f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market"></a>

The Charlottenburg markets were out the front of Charlottenburg Palace, with
lots and lots of food places. I had myself an epic roast dinner, then a huge
Hungarian donut thing before stumbling home to my hostel to get ready for my
flight the next morning to Spain.
