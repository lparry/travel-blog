First flight with ryanair on this trip. pretty much trouble free. seems absurd
they still mess about with unassigned seating, makes the boarding process so
much slower and inefficient, and it means they play silly games not announcing
the gate until 15 minutes before it closes so you have the fun of running from
one airport to the other to catch your flight. I heard they're finally phasing
it out. cant happen soon enough

Once I'd checked into my hostel I got in contact with my friend Erin who I met
in South Africa, who lives in Berlin on a semi-regular basis. We arranged to
meet up for dinner and a little introductory tour of the city. The timing was
actually cut pretty fine as Erin was headed over to the states only a few days
after I arrived.

We visited a small christmas market and had some gluh wien, walked around past
the museum island, postdama place, the hadrians gate, the jewish memorial, and
numerous other sites around the city. It was lovely to see Erin again and it
felt like I nice way to get to know the city being shown around by someone who
obviously loves the place.

I feel a bit bad about having zero photos with erin or the places we went to go
with this part of the post, but at times while travelling I've been hit by
"photo sorting fatigue", which leaves me in a state where I think to myself "if
I don't take any photos I wont have to sort any more!", which leads to gaps like
we have here.

We caught up again the next day to go and see templehoff park, an old airfield
that has been turned into a park, but still has all the runways and stuff there.
These days there's a community garden there and areas dedicated for having bbqs
and stuff. I seems like it would be a lovely place to visit in the sumertime,
and a great venue for a music festival.

We went out for pizza with Erin's housemates, Nicole and Nicole, to meet each
other and see how we got along and the possiblity of me taking Erins room while
she was away. They were both lovely and it seemed like it would be nice to live
in a typical german appartment for at least some of my stay in Berlin, and they
were happy to take me in, so I got to move in a few days after Erin left.

in my last few days at the hostel, I met a Dutch guy named Harmon who was a bit
of a history buff and a nice fellow so we decided to explore some stuff
together. We went to the Holocaust Museum, which was very interesting but there
was just too much information there to process it all so by 3/4 of the way
through I was skipping over 90% of the stuff and was pretty museum-fatigued.

To combat that we went into a nearby bar and had a few beers and got talking
with the bartender, a girl from Birmingham named Carley, who gave us some good
tips for neighbourhood to go exploring later in the evening.

We and to the Topography of Terror museum, built on/next to the foundations of
the SS and gestapo HQ, which was conincidentally right next to a long chunk of
the berlin wall that was still in place, wiht some large holes smashed in the
concrete.

It was great having Harmon there to fill in the massive gaps in my knowledge
about german history. I know we covered WWI and WWII in high school, but I don't
think we ever even touched on the cold war (I guess because australia played no
part in it, and our history always seemed (to me) to be biased towards things
that australia took part in, rather than important events that shaped the world
as it is today.

I never enjoyed history at school, but I now think that was largely because of
the stupidly narrow focus that my small rural high school had in its classes.
The stuff I've learned about while travelling about hte history in a ton of
other countries has been facinating. far more interesting than hearing about
australia's slaughtering in galiploi for the hundreth time, by some ex-army
history teacher.

The topograph of terror museum itself was another really good museum about the
various groups involed in executing the attrocities of WWII.  It focused a lot
more on the "who" and what they did rather than the victims; some very
interesting perspectives there, but again too much information to take in in
only one visit.


went to kottbusser tor, the suburb recommended by Carley earlier in the day, and
found that although an interesting suburb with a lot of cool street art, there
seemed to be nothing but turkish restaruants around. If you've read my post
about turkey, you'll know I love turkish food, but being freshly in Germany we
were really wanting some german food and it honestly felt a bit disappointing
that a single culture had so completely overrun this part of the city. Im pretty
sure there's a saturation point for kebab shops on any one street, and I'm
pretty sure the streets of Kottsbusser tor crossed that point long ago. We ended
up caving in and getting Turkish food since there seemed like no other option,
and it was quite frankly disappointing. overpriced and dry, leaving me even more
confused how such a restaurant can survive in the face of so much competition?

After dinner we went to a tapas bar for a while to soak in the bohemian/hipster
vibe before heading over the bridge near Warschauer strasse into a district of
old warehouse converted into bars and stuff, and loads and loads of awesome
grafiti.

found a little bar in what seemed to be a multipurpose building. at various
times I saw different doors open and I'm sure I saw 2-3 different bars, a music
recording studio looking room and a juggling studio up stairs. very eclectic
mix.

live music, had a guy playing a pan flute and a eukelae, then more musicans
arrived with other strange instruments. a mouth harp and somthing that looked
kind of like a sitar/accordian with a little wind-y thing at one end. bag pipe
with inoffensive tuning? then some folk dancing.

karl marx allie. lots of old massive east german constructed buildings.
communist "ads" on top of a few buildings, sputnik on top of a cafe. highlight
was a pretty epic videogames museum. every old console imaginable and loads of
classic games. special exibit with the many different iterations of donkey kong.
arcade machines.


drank a lot of great beers, ate some amazing wiener schnitzel

did a lot of exploration around berlin taking in the street art. probably at
least 4-5 days worth in total if all added up. some "self guided" walking tours,
one "real berlin" free walking tour that seemded heavily street art focused and
I swear our guide must have been well tied in with the street art communitiy
based on how much he seemed to know about individual artists, techniques etc,
and a lot of solo exploration.

on one of my explorations I stumbled upon random buskers who were so damn good I
stopped and listned to them for probably an hour. these guys called the trouble
notes. one guy on electric violin, one guy finger picking the heck out of a
guitar while also using it as a precussion instrument, and another dude sitting
on a strange square box drum. very beautiful sound. bought a cd to support them,
even though I have nothing to play it in, and got a flyer for a show later in
the month in a very hidden away warehouse.


Moved in with the nicoles on the day of a crafternoon that was still in
progress. hung out trying to make an origami animal (damned if I can remember
what the animal was) but we struggled with it for a very long time before
reading in the front of the book the instructions (I thought only men didn't
read instructions, but now I know better :P) and then Nicole A was able to
successfuly make the animal!
