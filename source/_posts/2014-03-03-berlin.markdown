Flying to Berlin was my first flight with Ryanair on this trip, and it was
pretty much trouble free. It did seem absurd that they still mess about with
unassigned seating, which makes the boarding process so much slower and
inefficient than on normal airlines, and it means they play silly games not
announcing which gate you need to be at until 15 minutes before it closes so you
have the fun of running from one end of the airport to the other to catch your
flight. I heard they're finally phasing it out; that cant happen soon enough
IMO.

Once I'd gotten into Berlin and checked into my hostel I got in contact with my
friend Erin, an American who I met in South Africa who lives in Berlin on a
semi-regular basis. We arranged to meet up for dinner and she offered to give me
an introductory tour of the city. It was pretty lucky timing as Erin was leaving
Berlin for a month just a few days after I arrived.

We  walked all around the city, past the museum island, Potsdamer Platz,
Brandenburger Tor, The Jewish Memorial, and loads of other sites around the
city. It was quite the whirlwind introduction to the city, we even visited a
small Christmas market and had some gluhwein! Delicious spiced wine served hot,
perfect for the cold nights leading up to Christmas. It was lovely to see Erin
again and it felt like a nice way to get to know the city being shown around by
someone who obviously loves the place.

I feel a bit bad about having zero photos with Erin or the places we went to go
with this part of the post, but at times while travelling I've been hit by
"photo sorting fatigue", which leaves me in a state where I think to myself "if
I don't take any photos I wont have to sort any more!", which leads to gaps like
we have here.

We met up again the next day to go and visit Tempelhof Park, an old airfield
that has been turned into a public park, but still has all the runways and stuff
there. It's kind of surreal to be wandering around one what quite obviously was
a fairly big airfield, with people jogging past or cycling on bikes.  These days
there's a community garden there and areas dedicated for having BBQs and stuff.
It seems like it would be a lovely place to spent time at in the summertime, and
would make a great venue for a music festival.

We went out that night for pizza with Erin's housemates, Nicole and Nicole, as a
chance to meet each other and see how we got along, and to see about the
possibility of me taking Erin's room while she was away. The two Nicoles were
both lovely and it seemed like it would be cool to live in a typical German
apartment for at least some of my stay in Berlin. They were happy to have me
take the room, so I got to move in a few days after Erin left.

In my last few days staying in the hostel I met a Dutch guy named Harmen who was
a bit of a history buff and seemed like a nice fellow, so we decided to explore
some of the city together. We went to the Holocaust Museum, which was very
interesting but there was just too much information there to process it all, so
by 3/4 of the way through I was skipping reading 90% of the text and was pretty
well museum-fatigued.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525055773/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/13525055773_8cd2455173_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe"></a>

To combat that we went into a nearby bar for a rest and a few beers. We got talking
with the bartender, a girl from Birmingham named Carley, who gave us some good
tips for some neighbourhoods to go exploring later in the evening.

After we felt able to tackle another museum we headed to the Topography of
Terror museum, a museum built right next to the foundations of the headquarters
of the Secret State Police, the SS and the Reich Security Main Office of the
Third Reich.  Its also coincidentally right next to a long segment of the Berlin
wall that was still in place, complete with some large holes smashed in the
concrete.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525750244/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3785/13525750244_66e9ee1851_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall"></a>

It was great having Harmen there to fill in the massive gaps in my knowledge
about German history. I know we covered the World Wars in high school, but I
don't think we ever even touched on the cold war (I guess because Australia
played no part in it, and our history classes seemed to have been very biased
towards things that Australia took part in, rather than important events that
shaped the world as it is today.

I never really enjoyed history at school, but I now think that was largely
because of the incredibly narrow focus that my small rural high school had in
its classes.  The stuff I've learned about while travelling about the history in
a bunch of other countries has been fascinating. Far more interesting than
hearing about Australia being slaughtered at Gallipoli for the hundredth time.

The Topography of Terror museum was another really good museum, covering the
various groups involved in carrying out the atrocities of WWII. It focused a lot
more on the "who" and what they did; some very interesting perspectives there,
but again too much information to take it all in in only one visit.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525606303/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Spaceman by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/13525606303_19c05ecd34_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Spaceman near Kottbusser"></a>

Harmen and I then went to Kottbusser Tor, the suburb recommended to us by Carley
earlier in the day, and found that although it seemed like an interesting suburb
with a lot of cool street art, there seemed to be nothing but Turkish
Restaurants around. If you've read my post about Turkey, you'll know I adore
Turkish food, but being newly in Germany we were really wanting to eat some
German food and it honestly felt a bit disheartening that a single culture had
so completely squeezed out all others in the food scene in this part of the
city. I'm would think there's a saturation point for number of kebab shops you
really need on any one street, and I'm pretty sure the streets of Kottbusser tor
crossed that point long ago.

We ended up caving in and getting Turkish food since there seemed like there was
no other option, and it was quite frankly disappointing. Overpriced and dry,
leaving me even more confused how such an average restaurant can survive in the
face of so much competition?

After dinner we went to a tapas bar for a while to soak in the bohemian/hipster
vibe they had going on there, before heading over the bridge near Warschauer
Stra√üe station into a district of old warehouses that had been converted into
bars, skate parks, climbing centres and all kinds stuff, all decorated outside
with loads and loads of awesome graffiti.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13562682523/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Mural by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/13562682523_baf9b0ce7d_c.jpg" width="800" height="396" alt="Mural"></a>

We found a nice little bar in what seemed to be a bit of a multi-purpose
building. At various times I saw through different doors and I'm sure I saw 2-3
different bars, a room that looked to be some sort of music recording studio,
and what I think might have been a juggling studio up stairs. Quite an eclectic
mix.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525867974/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hipster folk music by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/13525867974_09174cf869_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hipster folk music"></a>

They had some live music happening in the bar, initially a single guy
alternating between playing a pan flute and a ukulele, then more musicians
arrived with other strange instruments. One woman had a mouth harp, another guy
had something that looked like the love-child of a sitar and an accordion with a
little crank at one end, and the original guy switched over to playing something
that appeared to be a bag pipe, but with inoffensive tuning. For serious, a bag
pipe without the piercing pitch. They two of them started doing some folk
dancing. It was quite the cool little show. Brunswick hipsters, eat your heart
out.

Another day I went an walked along Karl-Marx Allee, a huge boulevard built by
the GDR/DDR, I guess to show off how great communism is. It is lined with lots
of massive buildings built during the early years of the Cold War.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13526156075/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Big East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13526156075_e9e5c61fe9_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Big East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee"></a>

There are some interesting communist "ads" on top of a few buildings,
interesting because being communist meant there wasn't really a need for any
advertising since there was no competition between companies, but there were ads
for stuff in West Berlin and didn't want to be outdone by them.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525982215/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Communist era advertising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/13525982215_8b0917a31b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Communist era advertising"></a>

There was also a small model of Sputnik on top of a cafe.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13526227694/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Cafe with Sputnik on top of it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3701/13526227694_48e9c1fe96_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cafe with Sputnik on top of it"></a>

But the highlight for me, completely unrelated to it's socialist past, was the
epic video game museum. It contained pretty much every console imaginable and
loads of classic games, and some classic arcade machines too. The place brought
out a huge amount of nostalgia in me, so many great memories.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13538254253/in/set-72157643245435323" title="So much video game history by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3771/13538254253_f0fd2c472a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So much video game history"></a>

Some pieces of note included the original Sega Master System, my first
every console,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13527934633/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sega Master System by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/13527934633_574d3fd060_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Sega Master System. NFI why it says Mark III, this was the one before the SMSII in Australia"></a>

A virtual reality machine I have memories of paying way too much to have a turn
of at a video game arcade somewhere in Queensland when I was a kid,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13528085255/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3756/13528085255_3da8f04e72_c.jpg" width="645" height="800" alt="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid"></a>

An Apple II, signed by the brains behind it, Steve Wozniak,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13528026095/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Apple II, signed by Woz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7090/13528026095_1e823e32aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="605" alt="Apple II, signed by Woz"></a>

And this very unique arcade machine called the PainStation, which was a multi
player game that burnt, electrocuted and whipped the players while they played a
game, whoever flinched away first lost.
[Seriously](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13536673074/in/set-72157643245435323).
It wasn't switched on so I can't say how bad the pain really was.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13536495093/in/set-72157643245435323" title="PainStation by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/13536495093_06657420b0_c.jpg" width="598" height="800" alt="PainStation"></a>

I did a huge amount of exploration around Berlin appreciating the street art,
probably at least 4-5 days whole days worth in total if you added it all up. I
did a few "self guided" walking tours (as in I had an itinerary or stuff to look
for found somewhere online), A ton of randomly wandering after spotting a cool
piece by chance, and a "Real Berlin" free walking tour that seemed to be quite
heavily street art focused.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567379395/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Rainbow drips by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/13567379395_6fc9b174a3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rainbow drips"></a>

On one of my many aimless explorations I stumbled upon some buskers playing in
the street who were drawing quite a crowd.  A band called [The Trouble
Notes](http://www.thetroublenotes.com/). One guy planing an electric violin, one
guy finger picking the heck out of a guitar while also using it as a percussion
instrument, and another dude sitting on a unique drum that was just kind of a
square box. They had a very beautiful sound and were so damn good I stopped and
listened to them for probably an hour.  I even bought a CD to support them, even
though I have nothing to play it in! And I got a flyer for a show later in the
month in a very hidden away warehouse.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13553720455/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The Trouble Notes are awesome! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/13553720455_f90767f22c_c.jpg" width="679" height="800" alt="The Trouble Notes are awesome!"></a>

I moved in with the Nicoles on the day of a "crafternoon" that was still in
progress when I arrived. I hung out and tried to make an origami animal that had
been stumping everyone all afternoon (damned if I can remember what the animal
was now), but we struggled with it for a very long time before finding out there
were instruction in the front explaining all the different arrows.  With this
Nicole A was able to successfully make the animal! (I thought only men didn't
read instructions, but now I know better :P)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13562823055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Fancy car and a colourful wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5457/13562823055_133c3262f8_c.jpg" width="800" height="357" alt="Fancy car and a colourful wall"></a>

I spent an entire day exploring the street art around Warschauer Stra√üe
Station, in and amongst the converted warehouse along Revaler Stra√üe. The area
oozes creativity, with nearly every surface being covered in a colourful mural
and most of the people looked like the sorts of folk my dad would look at
disapprovingly as dirty hippies, my kind of people :)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564232873/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Berlin by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/13564232873_e9b584efaf_c.jpg" width="800" height="447" alt="Berlin"></a>

I walked along the nearby East Side Gallery, a 1.3km long section of the wall
that is not used as an open air art gallery. There over 100 painting, all of
them huge. There was also a whole row of Trabants, the car of East Germany,
parked along the side the wall.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13563950605/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Trabants by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/13563950605_04431b441e_c.jpg" width="800" height="752" alt="Trabants"></a>

I walked the whole length of the wall and then some of the backside as well and
was lucky enough to come upon a bunch of artists spending their Sunday afternoon
painting the backside of the wall and having a few beers. Work in progress

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564854475/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sunday drinks while painting the wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/13564854475_694238308f_c.jpg" width="800" height="290" alt="Sunday drinks while painting the wall"></a>

Another day I went on a "Real Berlin Walking Tour", as recommended by a friend
who lived in Berlin briefly. The tour had a strong focus on graffiti and street
art, which I didn't know about beforehand and meant we went to several places
I'd already checked out. It was great a knowledgeable guide there to point
specific artists works and styles, and then start recognising their stuff all
around the city.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565480803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Garbage Elephant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/13565480803_2d4637d7f0_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street"></a>

I think our guide must have been well connected in with the street art community
based on how much he seemed to know about individual artists, techniques, etc. I
almost suspect he may have been one of the artists, although he denied it when I
asked.

On the tour I learned some more about the Berlin wall and the Cold War. One
interesting titbit I picked up was that West Berlin was the only part of West
Germany that didn't have conscription, which led to many of the liberals
migrating there, which could explain the very liberal culture that exists there
today.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565231714/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/13565231714_49c68617c3_c.jpg" width="800" height="391" alt="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river"></a>

I also learned how property developers have been allowed to start developing
along the lovely green strip behind the long strip of wall that makes up the
East Side Gallery, what a fuck up! I thought the one building that was in
progress when I walked along there was a horribly inconvenient eye sore, meaning
you could no longer walk along the full length of both sides of the wall. To
find out they're now planning on building along most of that strip, including a
section currently occupied by an African Youth support centre who are being
evicted, is terrible.  Wikipedia even tells me they're going to knock down
extensive segments of the gallery.

Another day I visited the Deutsches Technikmuseum, the German Museum of
Technology. I love science and technology museums as a rule, although this one
had such a heavy focus on trains and planes that you could be forgiven for
thinking it was a transport museum.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568945104/in/set-72157643245435323" title="This musuem had a crazy number of planes in it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/13568945104_6685df757b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically"></a>

I especially liked this jet engine that was opened up so I could poke my head
inside and get an idea of the insides of one of those things and how the
"reverse thrust" thing planes do to stop actually works. I've since tried to
look out the window as a flight was landing to try and see this in action but
the wing gets in the way. :(

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568499815/in/set-72157643245435323" title='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/13568499815_3175e0b7e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position'></a>

Admittedly there were some other smaller sections about old bicycles, medicine,
photography, old mechanical computers and televisions.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567596055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wooden bike by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7077/13567596055_f5671ee900_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wooden bike, totally hipster"></a>

Some of the old televisions had Cathode Ray tubes so long that they would
orienty them with the screen facing the ceiling, and then use a 45¬∫ mirror to
flip the image so a sitting viewer could watch it. To think today there are
2+ metre televisions that are only a few cm thick... The progress of technology
is awesome!

One evening while I was still staying with the two Nicoles, I went and saw The
Trouble Notes do a live show with them and a friend of theirs. The venue was an
old building hidden down a very dark alley, surrounded by building that felt
like they were largely abandoned. It felt like the kind of place you went down
to get stabbed, but it turned out ok for us. The Trouble Notes put on very good
show, even if the support act was a bit too emo and the venue was super smoky.
It really feels like I got in a time machine and went back 20 years to be back
in a place where you can smoke in public venues.


I spent a few days exploring the various museums on the Museum Island. First up
was the Pergamon museum, which has in it's collection a giant Babylonian gate,
and an ancient temple plundered from turkey.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570513833/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Pergamon Altar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/13570513833_b093193675_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pergamon Altar"></a>

I read up and learnt that the Babylonian gate on display is actually the
smaller, rear-side of the entrance way. The front must have been absolutely
epic!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570336943/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Ishtar Gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7338/13570336943_508a1c623f_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ishtar Gate"></a>

The New Musuem was great, I found the building itself to be very interesting,
with each room styled differently and quite uniquely. Much of it has been
reconstructed since the war. It's funny, the place felt too old to be calling it
the new museum.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570806863/in/set-72157643245435323" title="More plundered loot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/13570806863_91ff2f0594_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="More plundered loot"></a>

I also went to the Old Museum which looks majestic from the outside, but I felt
the inside of the building lacked any real character and was rather dull and
sterile.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570964433/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The old museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/13570964433_e1959ec409_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The old museum"></a>

One morning I booked in to visit the Reichstag Building (the German Parliament),
a building with an impressive glass dome on top of it, which you can go up for a
nice view. It's free but you have to book online in advance.

Surprise track work meant that I was pretty late, I'd left home cutting things
pretty fine according to Google maps estimations, but then there were no trains
running on the line I needed to change to, so I had to go to another station on
a different line, then practically run to try and get there near the time I was
scheduled to, all the while being mobbed by supposedly deaf street collectors.

They hand you a card with a little statement in a bunch of languages asking you
to sign their clipboard (petition? I cant remember), then if you don't read that
clipboard you suddenly find you've signed up to make a donation.  Call me a
cynic, but those deaf collectors look just like the gypsies in every other city
in Europe.  I suspect they've just come up with a new way of extracting money
from people without having to speak any language in particular.

It was a very impressive building, the inside of the dome containing a structure
of mirrors to collect and reflect light down into the parliament, lessening the
need for artificial lighting.

There was a ramp spiralling up around the dome, with an audio guide that is
automatically activated as you walk around, giving you a great (but hard to
photograph) view of the city in all directions.


checkpoint charlie museum. way better than I expected. lots of intresting
stories about escapes hidden in cars, welding machines, a pair of suitcases side
by side, balloons, gliders. the musuem was actually huge, but i think the layout
means most people miss half of it, I had the place to myself in that section.

sachenhausen concentration camp, out at oranienburg. 2 km walk from the station
in the literally freezing cold mist.

got the audio guide, found it to be another miss. very, very long winded, often
going way off topic. also sort of out of date, as far as a historic sitecan be
at least. mentions "hope to finish building by 2007", leaving me wondering if
they finished or not. quite the cliff hanger

camp used by the russian 45-50, lots of info but not very much good info to give
the whole picture durion that time. lots of personal account but none of them
tie together and I didn't get much of an idea what it was like.

founations of the gas chambers and the neck shot room were stil there but the
building were long gone.

infirmary had mention of there being a brothel on site, females prisoners forced
to work there, soldiers and selected prisoners used it as a reward

frozen puddles everywhere

misty rain as the sun set was freezing cold, but appropriate for the venue.
really sunk in how hard it would have been being a prisoner given only summer
clothes and made to stand out in the yard for 24 hours, not moving, on arrival

gluhwine seller on the exit was a live saver!

moved out of the nicoles place as they had a friend coming to stay, sad to be
leaving, there awesome people. so friendly and welcoming. little nicole is
bursting with an odd sort of positivity, so even at the end of a shitty day she
was still enthusiastic, but not in the "look on the bright side" way, more in
the "fuck that fuckface, and have a great day" way

moved to a hostel which was almost completely full of australians, aside from
the one staff member there.

erotic museum, sort of dull, oldest sex shop in the world, one floor about the
owner, 1 floor of drawings and what looked like kitch holiday souvineers

burgermeister, deliciously good.

back to the nicoles place the next night for thanksgivukah. lovely to see them
again and meet some of their friends. even met a girl also from australia, also
born in wagga wagga, also moved away at a young age. what are the odds?

lots of delicious vegitarian food and super sweet deserts, pumpkin cheesecake?

met up with Harmen again

ddr musuem. great museum, although it needs a bigger space. incredibly packed
for a museum, and then lots of stuff hidden behinds doors which were awkward to
open without blocking someone elses view. one really neat aspect was the east
german apparetment recreation, complete with bugs you could listen to from
another room.

looking little indoor market.

amazing pork knuckle, random 20% discount, tipped it right back again

fleece for edinburgh

back to the generator hostel where it started exploring xmas market at alexander
platz. light a huge rural show, lights and rides. lots of delicious food and
gluhwein. regular stuff, with a shot of spirits or schapes, eierpunsch (yellow
and creamy like egg nog, super sweet, with whipped cream on the top). even
gluhbeir which was rich and sweet. ate some tasty shredded pork, and a bag of
donut hole things. felt sick from all the sweet stuff.
