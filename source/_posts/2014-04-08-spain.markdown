Even in winter the weather is Barcelona is lovely. As soon as I landed and got my
bag through customs I put my heavy winter jacket away and was quite happy in
just a T-shirt. It seemed like the warm weather would be great for helping me
kick a cold that had been hanging around for my last few weeks in Berlin,
that had left me sniffing and congested for far too long.

lazy walk around berlin enjoying the warmth

tapas, catalonian sausage and papas bravas, delicious but very garlicy


I took a free walking tour of Barcelona that went around a number of sites in
the heart of Barcelona and give background and history of the city. The tour
really made me realise how little I know about even recent Spanish history. I
did not know that they had a dictatorship right up until 1975, which was
apparently allowed by the rest of Europe because the dictator hadn't supported
Hitler in WWII.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807882714/in/set-72157643866689355" title="First glimpse of Caga Tio, the shitting log by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2840/13807882714_d5216a705b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First glimpse of Caga Tio"></a>

I also learnt about some rather unique Catalan Christmas traditions. The
first being Caga Tio (Literal translation: Uncle Shit), a happy looking log with
a face and a blanket. Each day leading up to Christmas the kids beat Caga Tio
with sticks "to help with digestion". Then on Christmas day, if the kids have
beaten him enough to help him with his digestion problems, they peer under his
blanket and find that he's pooped out a load of candy. An important life lesson
to teach your kids!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810536113/in/set-72157643866689355" title="So many caganers by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7126/13810536113_62c182214f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="So many caganers"></a>

The other strange Catalan Christmas tradition is the caganer. The caganer is a
little man, squatted over with his arse hanging out of his pants, and on the
ground behind him is a freshly made turd. He's apparently hidden somewhere in
every good Catalan persons nativity scene and the kids love to search for him.
There was stall after stall selling these caganers, which you can get with in
the likeness of all kinds of celebrities, the most distasteful being Nelson
Mandela the same week he died. The guide said the caganer was something to do
with representing giving back to the earth, but it just seems like they're
obsessed with poop to me.

One evening I arranged to meet up with one of my old Envato workmates Ibrahim,
and his beautiful wife Nathalie, to go and eat at a really nice tapas place they
had told me about.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807896004/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Tapas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7013/13807896004_9b77c7e756_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tapas"></a>

The place did not disappoint, everything we tried was delicious from the Spanish
ham and croquettes to the not-so-traditional perfectly cooked little steakettes,
with sangria to wash it down. I think my stand-out favourite was the sandwiches
with [sobrasada](http://www.paisdequercus.com/web/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/o/sobrasada_de_bellota.jpg)
(spreadable chorizo) and melted cheese. Spreadable meat seems like it should be
wrong, but it tasted fantastic. I'm told that when
[sturicho](/images/sturicho.jpg) was visiting he loved the stuff too;
Ibby said he probably would have brushed his teeth with the stuff if he could
have :P

It was lovely to see those two again, they're both such kind hospitable people.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807979643/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Palau Güell's beautiful entrance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7071/13807979643_2e3c6aae51_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palau Güell's beautiful entrance"></a>

I managed to get along to see Güell palace, a building that was once the home of
the Güell family, which was closed for renovations the last time I was in
Barcelona.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808355844/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Parabolic arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/13808355844_14212b2d48_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Parabolic arches"></a>

It's another very beautiful building designed by Gaudí, designed with lots of
smooth curves and vibrant colour. Gaudí used a lot of parabolic arches and other
unique geometry, in his designs which give both strength as well as visually
interesting features.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808807974/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Wrought iron work by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3801/13808807974_c1b85cb2b3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Wrought iron work"></a>

It featured a lot of quite complex wrought iron work which must have been made
by very skilled craftsmen. It was all so perfect and regular, it's hard to
believe it wasn't done by a machine.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808579334/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Palau Güell chimneys by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/13808579334_34846ded2c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palau Güell chimneys"></a>

Up on the roof there were heaps of colourful chimneys, no two the same. Many
were covered in broken bits of tile, a style heavily used by Gaudí in quite a
few of his works, but there were a few that were just red bricks laid in
interesting formations.

plaza de españa, old bullring that's been coverted into a shopping center. got
up on the viewing platform for free, nice view of the city. nearby hotel with an
infinity pool that the roof looks straight onto

monjac castle, memories from last time I was there, very much the same except
now it's free to enter.

date with Mercé, went to see the "magic fountain". ridiculous crowd and the show
was delayed, later fireworks went off and we found out it was for some very
wealthy families wedding. NYE standard, epic.

didn't really hit it off with merce, went to an irish bar for a few drinks
before parting ways.

went to sagrada la familia, but the queue went right around the block because of
the public holiday. went to park guell instead, but the public holiday meant it
was packed with people like a circus and not the peaceful, pretty park I
remembered. really challenging to get a photo of any of the real typical parts
of the park without some twat, or group of twats, posing in front of it. it was
like an endless line of people waiting to rush in. went home frustrated and
sick of being sick.

went to a couch surfing meeting at a little flamenco concert. met a bunch of
lovely south americans. flamenco show had interesting guitar and singing and
some very passionate dancing. I had a "front fow" seat, with mean the woman was
often looking right at me, 2ft away, making me a bit uncomfortable.

nice chillian girl, Natalia, insists that I get in touch with her where I go to
chilie or uragay, so she can hook me up with friends to stay with

went to casa batillo, another home designed by Gaudí. more lovely curves,
spirals and gradients of colours. the building looks like a dragon along the
rooftop from the outside. beautiful furniture, would have been an amazing place
to live.

went back to sagrada la familia, much shorter lines this day. has been made a
basiica by the pope in 2010. sadly lots of scaffolding covering my favourite
facade. ETA is 2030 so I may actually see it finished in my lifetime. realised
from a model they have of the completed design, that the 5-6 tallest towers
arent not built yet, so the "jesus" tower is going to be 2x as tall when it's
done. compltetely epic.

love all the clean completixy of all the shapes involved, all coming back to
simple math concepts. interesting museum underneath that I don't recall from
last time.

Started to wonder what my photos from last time I visited looked like, and if I
had enough foresight to take photos of both the completed and under construction
areas to compare. this time I took lots of photos which while just construction
now, will be great to look back on in 20 years, seeing this massive structure
still heavily in progress
