From Barcelona I got the overnight train to Granada. It left quite late in the
evening, and arrived in Granada at about 9 the next morning. I had some sleeping
pills and slept as well as is possible on a train, but was still exhausted when
I arrived.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916722755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13916722755_b4e79f4e47_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada"></a>

I headed to the hostel that I'd looked up online beforehand and checked that
they had a bed for me. It was too early to check in but they let me lock up my
bags in their storage room and allowed me to eat breakfast.

<!-- more -->

Over breakfast I got talking with a friendly girl named Emily from Adelaide, and
decided to go on a free walking tour with her and her other Adelaidian friend
Connor.


The tour was led by a nice guy named Borja, a student who'd been living in
Granada for some time. I also met some other friendly faces on the tour, Rachel
from Chicago, and Jack from Hobart.

The tour gave us a bit of an orientation of the old part of the city, and filled
us in on a bit of the history of the city. Granada had been held by the Moores
for quite some long period of time, which is why there's a lot of Moorish style
architecture.

On structure we visited with this old hamman (?)

One interesting thing I learn was about the trouble that UNESCO causes for the
home owners in Granada who can't afford to maintain their houses to the level
that UNESCO demands. This lead to huge fines and eventually having to give up
their houses to UNESCO. Apparently there is a huge proportion of abandoned
properties in the old city.

There's also a quite a large number of cave house on the hill above Granada.
Some of them have been there so long that they've been given land rights, while
others are considered illegal dwellings and the police occasionally come by and
evict lots of the people.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917231884/in/set-72157644104270734" title="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/13917231884_f6cf9e3973_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore"></a>

Borja told us he that he'd spent some time living in a cave house at one point,
looking after it for a friend, and told us what a friendly communal vibe the
older area of caves had.

He also let slip that Granada gets a bit lonely for young people because it's
such a student town.  Nobody stays for very long. Students come, they study and
then they leave so you only ever know people for a few years, tops.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917246354/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Blue and white ceramic Coke sign by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3715/13917246354_28b254f3fe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Blue and white ceramic Coke sign"></a>

After the tour finished up, just about everyone from the tour went and had lunch
at a tapas place, where the lunch special was 2â‚¬ for a beer and your choice of 3
tapas from their huge buffet. Quite the bargain! We all organised to meet up
again later in the evening to see a gig put on by a band that Borja played in.

The 2-3 beers and my tiredness from not getting good rest on the overnight train
meant that I went back to the hostel and slept for a few hours.

When I woke up I found Em and Connor down in the common area and we headed to
the bar. The streets are pretty narrow and winding, I'm sure I would never have
found the place if it weren't for Connor's superb navigation skills.

The Venue was tiny! The table we initially sat down at turned out to double as
a makeshift stage, so we shifted back a little to give the band some room. The
place was jam packed too, although Borja later told us it gets busier than that.
I don't know where they'd fit the people.

Just about everywhere in Granada does some form of tapas with every drink. At
this place they would ask you how many drinks you'd had each time you ordered
another, and based on the number there was a certain sequence of little
delicious snacks that you'd get to accompany your beverage.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916878053/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Live music in a tiny little bar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/13916878053_e23947d397_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Live music in a tiny little bar"></a>

The band was great, there was a very informal feel to things and the singing was
very expressive. Rachel even broke out into song at one point, and can that girl
sing! If being a chef gets old, she's got potential to make a living from that
voice.

The next morning I ran into Em and Connor again at breakfast and we decided to
go up to the Alhambra together. On the walk there I managed to fall up a tiny
flight of two stairs, and sprained my left ring finger :(

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916827755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Connor & Emily at the path to the Alhambra by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/13916827755_4ca281df1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Connor & Emily at the path to the Alhambra"></a>

We had all heard stories about how you needed to book days in advance, but we
just turned up and got lucky, allocated a timeslot to enter the palace pretty
much right away, so we dashed past the rest of the Alahabra grounds and headed
straight there.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917389114/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Columns and carvings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13917389114_da6a381b04_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Columns and carvings"></a>

The palace was full of incredibly intricate carvings, in many place the carvings
went from the floor to the ceiling. It is hard to imagine how long it would have
taken to carve it all out with so much detail.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893897796/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Rich colours by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/13893897796_085e34aa23_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rich colours"></a>

A few parts had been restored (several hundred years ago?) and still had some
paint remaining. It would have been mind blowing to see the place fully painted
back in the time it was used as a palace.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893863532/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Leave no surface uncarved by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/13893863532_392ee084ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leave no surface uncarved"></a>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916961855/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Beautiful patterns by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/13916961855_f16db6cb33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful patterns"></a>

I learned about an interesting restoration technique from one of the info
boards, where they embed the new material used in restoration with a UV reactive
substance, so it appears plain to the naked eye but can still be obvious which
parts are truly original to the historians studying the structure.

I went through the palace at a very slow pace, and at some point Rachel had
arrived and caught up with me, and the two had moved through much quicker and
finished well before us, so it was good that we'd organised to meet up somewhere
later on if we got separated.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893925392/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Round courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13893925392_1a7b0067cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Round courtyard"></a>

Rachel and I ended up exploring the rest of the Alahabra grounds together. We
found this huge square building that had a circular open courtyard in the
middle, and now housed some museums and art galleries that we did an obligatory
quick pass through.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917101303/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The view towards the new city by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/13917101303_643cec571e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The view towards the new city"></a>

We climbed up the towers next to the barracks, which gave a great view out to
the city of Granada, and an interesting aerial view of the foundations of the
barracks.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917480704/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Soldiers barracks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7295/13917480704_933abe24e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Soldiers barracks"></a>

The time I'd organised to reconvene with Connor and Emily was quickly
approaching, so it was very convenient when we ran into them again up on top of
one of the towers, and agreed to scrap that plan and organised something else.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893944911/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Waterjets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7235/13893944911_34bb93d54d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterjets"></a>

The last part of the complex we visited was the Generlalife gardens, which
featured a lot of beautiful fountains and water gardens.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917089765/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Garden fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2932/13917089765_9f4cbb3592_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Garden fountain"></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893979231/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Water Stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7133/13893979231_d013b17942_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The Water Stairway"></a>

On the little booklet about the Alahabra it makes special mention of a
water-staircase, so Rachel and I got it into out heads it would be something
quite impressive to behold. Instead it turned out to be a pretty plain old
staircase with a little channel of water running down the hand-rail of either
side, be we made up a story about how it must of at least be special royal
water, not the regular peasant stuff they give to everyone else.

All the walking around the Alhambra had made us a bit hungry so we sought out
somewhere to have a few beers and the free tapas they'd come with. We passed by
a lot of places that seemed a little too fancy to offer a good beer and tapas
deal, and eventually found a cute little place called Boabdil. It was a small
place down a little alleyway, off another alleyway with very utilitarian decor.
Stainless steel benches, fixed stools and bay-maries full of food. It turned out
to be a great choice, with really tasty food and the drinks were only 1.70!

We got a message from Em and Connor and let them know where we were, so we could
regroup and head the fountain, meeting place of the afternoon walking tour to
the caves on the hill that we wanted to do. It turned out it was being led again
by Borja, a lovely surprise. Jack was also back for more, and had apparently
been up to the Alhambra that day as well, although we didn't manage to bump into
him.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917536504/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The illegal cave homes on the hill by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7366/13917536504_2e47accf22_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The illegal cave homes on the hill"></a>

Cave tour took us up the hill to a few nice view points, then up to the hippy
caves, only a few of who have power via solar panels. even these caves were a
lot more established than I had been expecting

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917167763/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Now that looks like a cave home by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5163/13917167763_e40557b381_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Now that looks like a cave home"></a>

Went right up to a nice wall to sit on and watch the sun set, then walked down
the other side via the less established cave section. random couch overlooking
the valley. got told about an old dude running a tea cafe out of a cave over the
other side of the hills.

tour ended and we went on a little tapas crawl, first place had awesome jamon,
next place had delicious cheese and jamon

went to a flamenco show, only 6E. was worth seeing, but not something Iâ€™d seek
out again. the dancing is impressive but the singing isnâ€™t to my liking and the
little cave/basement it was in was pretty dingy.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894038541/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Flamenco show by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7389/13894038541_a0f16743cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flamenco show"></a>

next day

went up to the Alhambra gardens with Em, Connor and Rachael

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894058432/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Lovely gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/13894058432_536c27a832_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lovely gardens"></a>

Went and found ismael, the hippy dude who lived over the hill in a cave and ran
a teteria. beautiful view and amazingly fancy tapas with our tea

hung out at the hostel for a bit, then went out for a drink with the girls,
before em and Connor had to go get their lift to seville

went to Nuestro Bar, recommended by Chris Kolester with Rachel, fairly large
serves of lots of fried food. very cheap, but not the best quality

Went exploring with rachael, started in the jewish district, then went over
where there was supposed to be lots of graffiti, then went over around the
cathedral

went and found alahabra beer at a pretty nice tapas place for lunch. had bacon
cheese rolls, prawns, chorizo, delicious spicy salty squid

went for a walk/hike along the other side of the river, nice view of the caves,
found some more caves on that side of the river too.

went exploring up the hill again in search of snail restaurant, but sadly it was
closed. energy levels plummeting, came down the hill and parted ways for a few
hours to rest and sort out my plans for cordoba

Met up with Rachael and went to Babel tapas bar, world fusion food. very tasty
but the service was very poor. two drinks and tapas took probably and hour and a
half.

then went back to the ultra budget place from the other day, delicious tapas,
cheerful bartender, beer had a funny taste but was cheap enough to make up for
it. ordered some snails, a huge bowl full (like 40 snails or something) they
were kind of odd textured, but not particularly great. I prefer the french style
ones where you get 6 and they just taste like butter and garlic.

went to los diamontes, seafood tapas place. pretty disappointing. very noisy, no
music and the prawns they served us were still with shells

decided to call it a night after that

checked out of hostel and then chilled in the common area for a while on my
laptop

went out to have a look at clothing shops around granada, so many awesome hippy
clothes, loads of stuff way different than anything at rainbow serpent, lots of
it made in nepal. I should go there on a shopping trip

got the bus to Plaza de Toro to meet AndrÃ©s, the guy from blablacar who I got a
lift to Cordoba with. He drove quite a nice BMW, only 2 doors and actually kind
of cramped with 4 people in it but a pleasant experience all the same

found hostel, feels like I may be the only person in there

went out for a little explore of the town, very quiet, admittedly it is sunday
night

had FlamenquÃ­n for dinner, restaurant empty, pretty overpriced

came back to hostel, pretty tired. room to myself
