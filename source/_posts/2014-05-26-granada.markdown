From Barcelona I caught the overnight train to Granada. It left fairly late in the
evening and arrived in Granada at about 9am the next morning. I had some sleeping
pills and slept as well as is possible on a train, but was still exhausted when
I arrived.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916722755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13916722755_b4e79f4e47_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada"></a>

I headed straight to a hostel that I'd looked up online beforehand and checked
that they had a bed for me. It was too early to check in but they let me lock up
my bags in their storage room and allowed me to take advantage of their
breakfast buffet.

<!-- more -->

Over breakfast I got talking with a friendly girl named Emily from Adelaide, who
convinced me to go on a free walking tour with her and her other Adelaidian friend
Connor.

The tour was led by a nice guy named Borja, a student who'd been living in
Granada for some time. I also met some other friendly faces on the tour, Rachael
from Chicago, and Jack from Hobart.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893631012/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Inside the Hamam by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3758/13893631012_de64238da4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside an old Hamam (bath-house)"></a>

The tour gave us a bit of an orientation of the old part of the city, and filled
us in on a bit of the history of the city. Granada had been held by the Moors
for quite a long period of time, which is why there's a lot of Moorish style
architecture around the city.

One interesting thing I learn was about the trouble that UNESCO causes for the
home owners in Granada who can't afford to maintain their houses to the level
that UNESCO requires. This lead to huge fines and eventually having to give up
their houses to UNESCO. Apparently there is a huge proportion of abandoned
properties in the old city caused by this. It's troublesome to think about, you
want these places looked after, but it seems cruel and wasteful to force the
owners out because they can't afford the maintenance.

There's quite a large number of cave house on the hill above Granada. Some of
them have been there so long that the people living in them have been given land
rights, while others are considered illegal dwellings and the police
occasionally come by and evict lots of the people.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917231884/in/set-72157644104270734" title="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/13917231884_f6cf9e3973_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore"></a>

Borja told us he that he'd spent some time living in a cave house at one point,
looking after it for a friend, and told us what a friendly communal vibe the
older area of caves had.

He also let slip that Granada gets a bit lonely for young people because it's
such a student town.  Nobody stays for very long. Students come, they study and
then they leave so you only ever know people for a few years maximum.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917246354/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Blue and white ceramic Coke sign by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3715/13917246354_28b254f3fe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Blue and white ceramic Coke sign"></a>

After the tour finished up, just about everyone on the tour went and had lunch
at a tapas place, where the lunch special was â‚¬2 for a beer and your choice of 3
tapas from their huge buffet. Quite a bargain! We all organised to meet up
again later in the evening to see a gig put on by a band that Borja played in.

The 2-3 beers, and my tiredness from not getting good rest on the overnight train,
meant that I spent my afternoon back at the hostel and slept for a few hours.

When I woke up I found Em and Connor down in the common area and we headed to
the bar where the band was to play. The streets are pretty narrow and winding,
I'm sure I would never have found the place if it weren't for Connor's superb
navigation skills.

The Venue was tiny! The table in the corner we initially sat down at turned out
to double as a makeshift stage, so we shifted back a little to give the band
some room. The place felt jam packed too, although Borja later told us it gets
busier than that.  I don't know where they'd fit the people.

Just about everywhere in Granada does some form of tapas with your drinks. At
this place they would ask you how many drinks you'd had each time you ordered
another, and based on the number there was a certain sequence of little
delicious snacks that you'd get to accompany your beverage.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916878053/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Live music in a tiny little bar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/13916878053_e23947d397_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Live music in a tiny little bar"></a>

The band was great, lots of good covers, and there was a nice informal feel to
things. Rachael even broke out into song at one point, and can that girl sing!
If being a chef gets old, she's got potential to make a living from that voice.

The next morning I ran into Em and Connor again at breakfast and we decided to
go up to the Alhambra together. On the walk there I managed to fall up a tiny
set of two stairs, and sprained my left ring finger. ouch! :(

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916827755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Connor & Emily at the path to the Alhambra by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/13916827755_4ca281df1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Connor & Emily at the path to the Alhambra"></a>

We had all heard stories about how you needed to book days in advance, but we
just turned up and got lucky. We were allocated a timeslot to enter the palace
pretty much right away, so we dashed past the rest of the Alhambra grounds and
headed straight there.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917389114/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Columns and carvings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13917389114_da6a381b04_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Columns and carvings"></a>

The palace was full of incredibly intricate carvings, in many place the carvings
went from the floor to the ceiling. It is hard to imagine how long it would have
taken to carve it all out with so much detail.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893897796/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Rich colours by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/13893897796_085e34aa23_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rich colours"></a>

A few parts had been restored (several hundred years ago IIRC) and still had some
paint remaining. It would have been mind blowing to see the place fully painted
back in the time it was used as a palace.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893863532/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Leave no surface uncarved by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/13893863532_392ee084ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leave no surface uncarved"></a>

I learned about an interesting restoration technique from one of the info
boards, where they embed the new material used in restoration with a UV reactive
substance, so it appears plain to the naked eye but can still be obvious which
parts are truly original to the historians studying the structure.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916961855/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Beautiful patterns by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/13916961855_f16db6cb33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful patterns"></a>

I went through the palace at a very slow pace, and at some point Rachael had
arrived and caught up with me, and the other two had moved through much quicker
and finished well before us, so it was lucky that we'd organised to meet up
somewhere later on if we got separated.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893925392/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Round courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13893925392_1a7b0067cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Round courtyard"></a>

Rachael and I ended up exploring the rest of the Alhambra grounds together. We
found this huge square building that had a circular open courtyard in the
middle, and now housed some museums and art galleries that we did an obligatory
quick pass through.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917101303/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The view towards the new city by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/13917101303_643cec571e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The view towards the new city"></a>

We climbed up the towers next to the barracks, which gave a great view out to
the city of Granada, and an interesting aerial view of the foundations of the
barracks.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917480704/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Soldiers barracks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7295/13917480704_933abe24e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Soldiers barracks"></a>

The time I'd organised to reconvene with Connor and Emily was quickly
approaching, so it was very convenient when we ran into them again up on top of
one of the towers, and agreed to scrap that plan and organised something else.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893944911/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Waterjets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7235/13893944911_34bb93d54d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterjets"></a>

The last part of the complex we visited was the Generalife gardens, which
featured a lot of beautiful fountains and water gardens.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893979231/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Water Stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7133/13893979231_d013b17942_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The Water Stairway"></a>

On the little map/booklet about the Alhambra it made special mention of a
water-staircase, so Rachael and I got it into out heads it would be something
quite impressive to behold. Instead it turned out to be a pretty plain old
staircase with a little channel of water running down the hand-rail of either
side, be we made up a story about how it must of at least be special royal
water, not the regular peasant stuff they give to everyone else.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917089765/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Garden fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2932/13917089765_9f4cbb3592_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Garden fountain"></a>

All the walking around the Alhambra had made us a bit hungry so we sought out
somewhere to have a few beers and the free tapas they'd come with. We passed by
a lot of places that seemed a little too fancy to offer a good beer and tapas
deal, and eventually found a cute little place called Boabdil. It was a small
place down a little alleyway, off another alleyway with very utilitarian decor.
Stainless steel benches, fixed stools and bain-maries full of food. It turned out
to be a great choice, with really tasty food and the drinks were only â‚¬1.70!

We got a message from Em and Connor and let them know where we were, so we could
regroup and head the fountain, meeting place of the afternoon walking tour to
the caves on the hill that we wanted to do. It turned out it was being led again
by Borja, a lovely surprise. Jack was also back for more, and had apparently
been up to the Alhambra that day as well, although we somehow never crossed
paths.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917536504/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The illegal cave homes on the hill by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7366/13917536504_2e47accf22_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The illegal cave homes on the hill"></a>

The cave tour took us up the hill behind the old city, past a few nice view
points of the Alhambra and the old city itself with the sun setting behind it.
Then eventually up among the (illegal) hippy caves, of which only a few of who
have electricity via solar panels. I was surprised to find that even these caves
were a lot more established than I had been expecting when I first heard "cave
house."

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917167763/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Now that looks like a cave home by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5163/13917167763_e40557b381_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Now that looks like a cave home"></a>

We went right up the top where a church (I think?) with a nice wall to sit on was built,
where we could sit and watch the sun set.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894015226/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/13894015226_a458e0d9de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset"></a>

After the sun had set we walked down the back side of the hill, via the newer,
less established area of caves. We learned that there's an old hippy dude way
further over in the hills who's lived there for years and runs a little teterÃ­a
there, a possible excursion for another day.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893997112/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Epic sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7396/13893997112_065be83db3_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Epic sunset"></a>

After tour ended the group went on a little tapas crawl to various bars, in the
interest of getting a good feed and a few drinks into us. The first place served
us awesome Spanish ham, with legs of ham hung up all around the place. The
second gave us delicious cheese and more ham, so tasty that we stayed for a few
rounds.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894038541/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Flamenco show by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7389/13894038541_a0f16743cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flamenco show"></a>

Next stop was a flamenco show at a little cave venue, for the princely sum of
â‚¬6. It was worth seeing for the sake of saying you'd done it, but it wasn't
really something I'd seek out again. The dancing is enthusiastic but this time
around I found the singing kind of whiny and not all that enjoyable, and the
little cave/basement it was in was pretty dark and dingy.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894058432/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Lovely gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/13894058432_536c27a832_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lovely gardens"></a>

The next day I went up to explore the gardens just below the Alhambra with Em,
Connor and Rachael. They were lovely and peaceful, and very well manicured.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894089151/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teterÃ­a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/13894089151_0dac8cbf10_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teterÃ­a"></a>

After we'd finished exploring there, we decided to go and try and find the
teterÃ­a we'd been told about the evening before, run by the old hippy dude
Ismael. After stopping to ask the locals which path to take a few times we
managed to find our way around the hill to to teterÃ­a which had a stunning view.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894101056/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Fanciest tea + tapas ever! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/13894101056_828b2b23a1_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fanciest tea + tapas ever!"></a>

We each had a tea which came out beautifully presented, each with it's own tasty
fruit tapas sitting on top! Easily the fanciest tea I've ever had!

In the evening Em and Connor had to go and meet up with someone who was giving
them a lift to Seville, but Rachael and I went to try and find Nuestro Bar, a
place that a friend who lived here for a while had told me about that was
supposed to have really great tapas.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917211833/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Alhambra at night by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/13917211833_b89bf08c6d_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The Alhambra at night"></a>

After walking for what seemed like forever we found the place. It seemed like an
ideal hangout for students (and backpackers!) on a tight budget. The drink
prices were very cheap and the tapas consisted of fried food in fairly large
serves, even if it was lacking a little in the quality department.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894138352/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Jewish district by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/13894138352_ae5d9cbba3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Jewish district"></a>

The next morning I went exploring the old city with Rachael. We started in the
Jewish district, which had many cobblestone paths featuring the star of David.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894162272/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Cobblestone artwork by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7176/13894162272_0f3cbee403_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cobblestone artwork"></a>

The surrounding area had lots of very ornate cobblestone paths in lots of
different patterns.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894176706/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Street art Owl in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/13894176706_bbd2e3d2a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Street art Owl in Granada"></a>

We explored around an area that our little tourist map told us was full of
street art and found quite a few very nice pieces.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894207302/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Bicycle powered merry-go-round by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/13894207302_8c4727d226_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bicycle powered merry-go-round"></a>

We ventured past a Christmas market at which it seemed like all of the
children's rides were human powered, for example this merry-go-round was turned
by a guy peddling a bicycle that was attached. Not sure if they're doing it to
save money on a motor, or to be environmentally friendly, but it seemed pretty
cool to me.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917758144/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Freaky street performer in front of a church by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/13917758144_ca2e006565_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Freaky street performer in front of a church"></a>

We passed by the Cathedral and saw this very freaky looking street performer
doing a "living statue" thing, which I stealthily took a photo of under the
guise of taking a picture of the church. When we got to close to the cathedral
some old gypsy ladies swarmed us, trying to give us rosemary, shouting stuff at
us in Spanish. I didn't want a bar of it but Rachael initially accepted their
rosemary before she realised they wanted money from her, and afterwards decided
that all the shouting they did at her was probably them putting a curse on her.

At lunchtime we sought out a place serving Alhambra brand beer (I seem to have
failed to note what the common beer was in my notes, but it was some other
beer), and we found a great tapas place that gave us bacon wrapped cheese rolls,
prawns, chorizo, and delicious spicy salty squid. I'm salivating just thinking
about them.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894696952/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Band jamming by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5030/13894696952_83c956412f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Band jamming"></a>

We decided to spend the afternoon doing a short hike we'd heard about that ran
along the other side of the river, and on out way there we happened to pass some
buskers that included the singer dude from the band a few nights earlier.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13918252094/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Kings and knights patrolling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7073/13918252094_7952020765_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Kings and knights patrolling"></a>

Then a King and a bunch of knights happened to wander past us. Just your average
afternoon in Granada!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894721682/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Looking back towards Granada and the hill of cave homes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2935/13894721682_474a0e52c5_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Looking back towards Granada and the hill of cave homes"></a>

We eventually made it to the other side of the river, and followed the path
along to quite a nice view of the caves, and found some more caves on the other
side of the river too. Caves everywhere!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894193162/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Caracol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2939/13894193162_206b181be6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Caracol"></a>

Rachael and I went and tracked down a restaurant we passed on the walking tour
the first day that served snails. Rachael, being a chef, wanted to see how the
Spanish served them, and I'm always eager to try strange foods. We did manage to
find it, but it was disappointingly closed.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894756511/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Tapas menu by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/13894756511_c3bbfc3231_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tapas menu"></a>

I'd looked up a list of best tapas places in Granada and we went to one called
Babel tapas bar, which claimed to serve world fusion food. The food was great but
the service was pretty poor. It took use nearly two hours to get two drinks each
and tapas. I happened to take a photo of the menu to give you an idea of the
sorts of stuff you get to pick from when you're buying a beer in one of these
places. I wish I'd thought to take more photos of stuff like this, and the tapas
itself.

We ended up going back to the cheap and tiny place from the previous day, in which
the very cheerful bartender was quick to serve us drinks and delicious tapas.
We saw they offered snails as a non-tapas dish, so we ordered a serve to try
them. What came out what a giant bowl full of snails, probably 40+ of them. I
though they had a kind of odd texture and weren't anything to write home about.
I think I prefer the French style ones where you only get a few and they're
drowned in butter and garlic.

We finished up the night at a place called Los Diamontes a seafood tapas place
which had rave reviews.  Unfortunately I think we must have gone to the wrong
one (there seems to be two with the same name in Granada). We got a serve of
regular sized prawns, shells and all :/ It was very noisy, all hard surfaces and
no music or anything to help with that. It felt like being in a shopping centre
food court except without the muzak. We decided to call it a night after that.

My last day in Granada I went out to have a look at some of the clothing shops
around the old city. There was lots of awesome hippy-style clothes, all of which
would fit in at the Rainbow Serpent market but very little of which actually
looked like designs I'd seen at Rainbow Serpent. I checked the tags on a few
things and most of it seems to be made in Nepal. Seems like it would be a good
place to go on a shopping trip.

Leaving Granada I tried using a ride sharing website I'd just learnt about
called Blablacar. I organised to get a lift to Cordoba, my next stop, with a guy
who was living in Granada on the weekends and working in Cordoba during the
week. He drove a fairly flash 2 door BMW, which was actually kind of cramped
with 4 people in it, but all in all it was a good experience. Seems like the
future of hitchhiking to me.
