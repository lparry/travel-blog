description: "The story of an irresponsible thirty year old man-child
              who decided he didn't want to wait until he was old to have
              a turn at enjoying retirement. Instead of following the common life path of getting
              married, buying a house, and having two kids, he's chosen
              to seek out epic adventures, see the world, and hopefully
              have great times that he'll reminisce about when he's old
              and senile."
